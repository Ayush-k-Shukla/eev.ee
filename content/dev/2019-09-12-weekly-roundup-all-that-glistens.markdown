- **fox flux**: I've been kind of taking a break from physics, but I did have some ideas about how extrinsic velocity could work, got them working for a conveyor belt, and then extended the same concept to a rough rework of pushing.  It works surprisingly well given how little time I spent on it, so that's very promising.

- **gleam**: I put together the first production VN with it, and although I had to cheat and hand-edit a bit, GLEAM grew a bunch of useful stubs of features along the way!  It's getting there.  Also I discovered a fascinating edge case in Firefox when you have 800 images visible but all but one of them have zero opacity.
