It sure has been one.

- **cc**: Got a basic NPC and some dialogue kinda working.

- **art**: Colored a picture.

- **blog**: Wrote a post about [how my relationship to tech has changed over time]({filename}/2017-08-09-growing-up-alongside-tech.markdown).

- **fox flux**: Still learning how to do foliage, but getting close to something I like.  Messed with my palette a bit.
