Despite flipping my sleep, as I seem to end up doing every month now, I've had a pretty solid week.  We finally got our hands on a Switch, so I just played Zelda to stay up a ridiculously long time and restore my schedule pretty quickly.

- **potluck**: I started building the potluck game in LÖVE, and it's certainly come along much faster — I have map transitions, [dialogue](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/875607643246665729), and a couple moving platforms working.  I still don't quite know what this game _is_, but I'm starting to get some ideas.

    I also launched [GAMES MADE QUICK??? 1½](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-one-and-a-half), a game jam for making a game while watching GDQ, instead of just plain watching GDQ.  I intend to spend the week working on the potluck game, though I'm not sure whether I'll finish it then.

- **fox flux**: I started planning out a more interesting overworld and doodled a couple relevant tiles.  Terrain is still hard.  Also some more player frames.

- **art**: I finally finished a _glorious_ [new banner](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/874198154270212096), which now hangs proudly above my Twitter and Patreon.  I did a [bedtime slate doodle](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/874952300510404609).  I made _and animated_ a [low-poly Yoshi](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/875187689015791616).  I [sketched Styx](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/875920656356986881) based on a photo.

    I keep wishing I have time to dedicate to painting experiments, but I guess this is pretty good output.

- **veekun**: Wow!  I touched veekun on _three separate occasions_.  I have basic item data actually physically dumping now, I fixed some stuff with Pokémon, and I got evolutions working.  Progress!  Getting there!  So close!

- **blog**: Per request, I [wrote about digital painting software]({filename}/2017-06-17-digital-painter-rundown.markdown), though it was hampered slightly by the fact that most of it doesn't run on my operating system.
  
I seem to be maintaining tangible momentum on multiple big projects, which is _fantastic_.  And there's still 40% of the month left!  I'm feeling pretty good about where I'm standing; if I can get potluck and veekun done soon, that'll be a medium and a VERY LARGE weight off my shoulders.
