This month's theme is **game dev**, and the major project is my text adventure, **Runed Awakening**.

Much better this week, though most of the effort went into blogging and fixing SLADE, and not so much went into my own game.  I'll try to remedy that this week.

- **art**: I drew stuff nearly every day all week, which is a great turnaround from my rut.  [This is pretty cute.](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/677244505825918977)  [So is this!](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/676865617807327232)  I had a flip through some of my drawings from earlier in the year and I can't believe how terrible they are and how not-terrible they sometimes are now.

- **irl**: I went through a huge pile of mail and whatnot that had accumulated under my keyboard.  Started dealing with taxes, oh boy.  I also did another round of going through an old hard drive I accidentally broke a couple years ago â€” the filesystem shattered a bit, so figuring out what's there and what's worth recovering has required some archaeology.  Found IRC logs from 2003, though.

- **SLADE**: I fixed some behavior related to working with a directory (vs working with a single-file archive), most notably teaching it not to delete files it doesn't know about.  I also implemented about 60% of `LOCKDEFS` support, i.e., having the UI actually tell you what numbers correspond to what keycards.

- **flora**: More planning for the card game.  Also a lot of work fixing the goddamn Rails nightmare that runs the [Flora store](https://store.floraverse.com/).

- **anachrony**: That's, uh, the Doom map set I'm working on.  I have no idea what I'm doing and it's really tough to figure out how to design spaces I really like, but that's the whole point of the exercise, so I go back to it every now and then.  I basically just tried out some ideas for connecting areas together and kinda like how it came out, so, that's good.

- **Runed Awakening**: I got a good bit of planning done!  No actual code written, oops; my time got eaten up by other stuff.  I also drew a [test illustration](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/677132623429390341) for an innocuous object, which was well-received, so I might end up illustrating _every_ object.  Maybe.

- **blog**: It took _several days_ but I finally finished [part 1 about how you should make a Doom level](http://eev.ee/blog/2015/12/19/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-1/).  Still awaiting the avalanche of incredible three-room maps.
