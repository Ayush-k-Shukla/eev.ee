I now have seven or eight things in-flight, which is _way too much_, so I've decided to make an active effort to spend four hours _every day_ working on some combination of veekun, the potluck game, my book, and Patreon blogging.  So far, so good.

Also, the rest of my Fridays and Saturdays have been reserved for working on Chaos Composer.  So, uh, yeah.

- **fox flux**: More portrait work, which was surprisingly difficult!  I forgot that drawing an actual picture with pixels is a little more involved in some ways than drawing it, uh, without pixels?  I also designed and drew a new NPC, vastly improved the sprites for a couple critters, and made a pretty good start on some terrain tiles for a new zone.

- **chaos composer**: I fixed a long-standing problem (two, actually) with the pixel scaling being slightly off.  I'm helping!  I also made a completely empty scene and wrote a basic player controller from scratch just to get accustomed, which I'll now probably throw away because one already exists.

- **veekun**: Added support for extracting move flags and Pokémon shapes (which were hell to find).  Wrote a move importer and wrote quick effect text for every move, so moves are now _in_ the database, hurrah!  I have a Pokémon importer mostly done, so that's well on its way as well.  I'm so close I can _taste_ it, though I expect I'll find a lot of minor followup work, and I haven't even touched more complicated stuff like wild Pokémon encounters.

Most of my four-hour blocks have been going to veekun so far.  I'd really like to get blog posts out of the way early for once, but both proposed topics are a little vague, and I'm not sure what I want to say about them yet.  I also still haven't spent _any_ time on my book this month, augh, and of course haven't touched the potluck game in a week now.

Meanwhile, most of my other time went to fox flux, where I'm just taking forever to do the art.  I think I'm starting to get better at it, but spriting an entire game is still a hell of a daunting task.

I spent the week working at a pretty good pace, yet this sounds like such little progress?  Making stuff just takes a while, I guess.
