- **potluck**: It's about time I actually started on this!  I spent a couple days squabbling with JavaScript frameworks, but in the end I gave up and decided to just build it on my existing LÃ–VE code.  Trying out a new thing is nice, but maybe not when I have a somewhat complicated game in mind that I want to build as soon as possible.

- **fox flux**: I made a font!  Also drew a ton of player sprites and made my grass much prettier.  I'm going to need to start thinking about environmental art soon, and I'm kinda dreading it because I have no idea what I'm doing there.

- **art**: I did some (unfinished) modelling and painted [some character art](https://twitter.com/squishfox/status/872557879294738432) (**warning**: this pic is fine, but the rest of the account is NSFW).

- **blog**: I wrote some thoughts about [teaching technical subjects]({filename}/2017-06-10-teaching-tech.markdown).
  
For the first time in possibly my entire life, I feel like I'm a little ahead of the game!  The month isn't even half over and I've already done some obligatory stuff, finished off one languishing task, and made some decent inroads into several other things.  Nice.
