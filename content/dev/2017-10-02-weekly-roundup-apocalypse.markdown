Uh, hey.  What's up.  Been a while.  My computer died?  Linux abruptly put the primary hard drive in read-only mode, which seemed Really Bad, but then it refused to boot up entirely.  I suspect the motherboard was on its last legs (though the drive itself was getting pretty worn out too), so long story short, I lost a week to ordering/building an entirely new machine and rearranging/zeroing hard drives.  The old one was six years old, so it was about time anyway.

I also had some...  internet stuff...  to deal with, so overall I've had a rollercoaster of a week.  Oh, and now my keyboard is finally starting to break.

- **fox flux**: I'm at the point where the protagonists are _almost_ all done and I've started touching up particular poses (times ten).  So that's cool.  If I hadn't lost the last week I might've been done with it by now!

- **devops**: Well, there was that whole computer thing.  Also I suddenly have support for colored fonts (read: emoji) in all GTK apps (except Chromium), and that led me to spend at least half a day trying to find a way to get Twemoji into a font using Google's font extensions.  Alas, no dice, so I'm currently stuck with a fairly outdated copy of the Android emoji, which I don't want to upgrade because Google makes them worse with every revision.

- **blog**: I started on a post.  I didn't get very far.  I still owe two for September.  Oops.

- **book**: Did some editing, worked on some illustrations.  I figured out how to get math sections to (mostly) use the same font as body text, so inline math doesn't look quite so comically out of place any more.

- **cc**: Fixed some stuff I broke, as usual, and worked some more on a Unity GUI for defining and editing sprite animations.

I'm now way behind and have completely lost all my trains of thought, though I guess having my computer break is a pretty good excuse.  Trying to get back up to speed as quickly as possible.

Oh, and happy October.  ðŸŽƒ
