I spent a good chunk of the week sick and/or becoming nocturnal, so not a lot of actual work resulted.  I'm feeling better now, though, and getting back into the swing of things.

- **art**: Did a lot of doodling, since that's fairly low-energy.  Probably the best thing to come out of it was some [character design slash concept art](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/853495588033253376) for Isaac's Descent HD.

- **games**: Streamed some more Eternal Doom.  Seems like every third map has some incredibly obtuse secret required for progression.

- **book**: Once I was over the plague, I got back into this, woo.  Wasted too much time squabbling with LaTeX before conceding defeat.  Working on explaining a bad approach to collision detection at the moment.

Now I can finally get to my plans for April: working on the book more and exploring art/music.
