Hi!  Sorry.  I'm a bit late.  I've actually been up to my eyeballs in _doing stuff_ for a few days, which has been pretty cool.

- **fox flux**: Definitely been ramping up how much I'm working on this game.  Finished another landing animation blah blah player sprites.  Some more work on visual effects, this time a cool silhouette stencil effect thing.

- **art**: Drew a pic celebrating 1000 followers on my nsfw art Twitter, wow!

- **blog**: Wrote half of another cross-cutting programming languages post, for October.  Then forgot about it for, uhhh, ten days.  Whoops!  Will definitely get back to that, um, soon.

- **writing**: Actually made some "good ass legit progress" (according to my notes) on the little Flora twine I'm writing, now including some actual prose instead of just JavaScript wankery.

- **bots**: I added a bunch more patterns to my [Perlin noise Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/perlin_noise) and finally implemented a little "masking" thing that will let me make more complex patterns while still making it obvious what they're supposed to be.

    Alas, while Twitter recently bumped the character limit to 280, that doesn't mean the bot's output can now be twice as big — emoji now count as two characters.  (No, not because of UTF-16; Twitter is deliberately restricting CJK to 140.  It's super weird.)

- **cc**: I got undo working with this accursèd sprite animation UI, and I fixed just a whole mess of bugs.

This week has been even _more_ busy, which I think bodes well.  I'm up to a lot of stuff, hope you're looking forward to it!
