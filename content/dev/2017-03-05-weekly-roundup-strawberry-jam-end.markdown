Hi!  It's been a while.  Per tradition, I didn't write roundups while in the middle of frantically working on a video game.

- **fox flux**: Mostly, I made a video game for a month-long game jam.  It's an hourish-long puzzle platformer and is **somewhat NSFW** but you can snag it from [itch.io](https://eevee.itch.io/fox-flux) if you like.  (If you install it via the [itch app](https://itch.io/app), it'll patch automatically and more quickly in the future.  Though I'm not sure how itch will handle the Linux "build", which is just a LÖVE file.)

    My ever-evolving physics code got some improvements again, but the biggest time constraint by far was the art — I am not very fast, and I had to learn a lot of things as I went.  I'll be writing about some of that in the near future.  Still, it's pretty cool that (with Mel's indispensable advice) I managed to produce enough art for a competent-looking game.

    I did all the sounds as well, though Mel composed the music, which made the whole thing _much better_.

    Post-release, I fixed a few critical bugs, and I've been working on some little vignettes to make the ending a bit less, er, anticlimactic.

- **bolthaven**: I also worked on Mel's game for the same jam, but the script turned out to be much longer than expected, so it wasn't finished in time.

- **blog**: I've started writing both a Patreon post for February and a spontaneous post on some art insights from the past month.

Lots of work, but a short summary.  I'm exhausted and moving a bit pokily these last couple days, but I'm more inspired than ever.  I've got a lot of stuff to catch up on and plenty more gamedev to do; hope you enjoy some of it!
