- **art**: I did a [little pixel animation](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/154026601797/doot-doot-doot-edit-opa-opa-suggested-theyre) and a lot of doodling trying to remember how to draw.  Almost a bit of character design, too.

    My pixel art keeps getting compliments, which is _really cool_, but at the same time I've been frustrated with how [lackluster](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/154091560317) my non-pixely art is.  I tried [repainting an idea from last year](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/154261518257/i-didnt-know-what-to-draw-so-i-went-looking) on a whim, but used the DB32 palette (which I've used for pixel art before), and it came out kind of_amazing_.  So that confirms my problem is color, and it's given me a few ideas for how to think about color differently.

- **isaac**: Level transitions now work, though the spawn point is still ignored, so it's pretty common to get stuck in a wall.  Isaac grew a simple jump animation and a...  [sleepytime sequence](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/154233276542/oh-no).  The appearing platforms now look much better, and the resurrection rune is now animated.

    The cave texture I had was kind of underwhelming, so I tried drawing a [new one](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/806680627672059904) at a higher resolution.  That stood out way too much, but after a few attempts and refinements, I ended up with [something very nice](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/807789950020112384) that also lets me draw edge tiles fairly easily.  I also wrote a shader from scratch for the very first time and was reminded of what a pain GLSL is!

    Between using a textured blending brush for a Bob Ross style background in the above painting, and a whole lot of studying Cave Story art (and actual cave walls) before finally landing on the tiles above, I feel like I've finally started to grasp some deeper idea about how the illusion of depth and form works.

- **music**: Finally, finally tried my hand at this for real.  I even made [a whole song](https://soundcloud.com/lexyeevee/garbage-cave-romp-1), which is not very good, but is better than having made zero songs.  I've sketched out a bunch of simple melodies, but none of them are particularly great yet; it's going to take a lot of experimentation before I can really make any music worthy of putting in Isaac HD.

    I also worked on recreating sound effects, with some modest success.  I'm not satisfied with what I have yet, but I've learned a _lot_ about combining waveforms and how to use a bunch of knobs in LMMS.  (I must've spent four to six hours just trying to make a satisfying grinding-rock sound.)

- **veekun**: I tracked down where most of the remaining Sun/Moon data is.  I'm still, er, trying to finish the game, but I'm getting close to the end, I think!

I'm having to teach myself half a dozen new things at once for the sake of Isaac HD, which feels like slow going but is ultimately kind of great.  I think I'm on a good pace to have the original levels playable by the end of the month.  (I don't intend to stop there by any means, but it's a great milestone.)

Not having four lengthy posts looming all month is a _huge_ weight off my shoulders, by the way.  I've barely even thought about writing tons of prose in a week and a half, and now I have enough prose juice saved up that working on a book for a while is sounding appealing!  This is great.  Thanks, y'all.  â™¥
