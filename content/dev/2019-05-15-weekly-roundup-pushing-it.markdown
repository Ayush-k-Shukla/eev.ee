I remember saying something about balancing my time better, and that did not happen.

- **fox flux**: I _basically_ spent the whole week working on push physics.  It was [tough going](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1126004263237242880) at first, but I finally [got it working correctly](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1127491933067141120) which feels like a goddamn Christmas miracle.

    I probably did some sprite work in there somewhere too, to let my brain cool down a bit.

    I'm excited about this game, ah!  There's a ton of work to go but I'm actually starting to see some mechanics come together.

- **stream**: Ash and I played a ridiculous adventure game for a bit.  Hm, maybe we should finish that.  It'll be on YouTube, uh, eventually.

Not so much this week; I ended up nocturnal and that threw me entirely for a loop.  Back to waking with the sun now and feeling pretty good, so, fingers crossed.
