Hello.  I don't know how I am!  But I did some stuff.

- **fox flux**: Workin' on a new walk animation.

- **gleam**: After years of saying I should totally do so, I finally started making a little editor for the [Floraverse web VN engine](https://apps.veekun.com/flora-cutscenes/).  I've been gradually teaching it to [load and play back](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1156357443208613888) the existing VNs (from scratch, because the old code is Quite Bad), and it's finally hitting the point where it's possible to [make something from scratch](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1158183550186692608).  Sort of.  I mean, there's no saving or loading or exporting, and a bunch of stuff is broken, but you know.  Getting there.  Maybe I'll even make a VN myself.

- **art**: I [started doing daily comics again](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1157041170834284544) and then forgot after day 1.

GLEAM has basically taken up my whole week; turns out that while client-side web stuff has improved dramatically, writing an editor is still an incredible pain in the ass.  Getting somewhere, though.

Oh, and that marks the end of my journal!  Cool, I guess.  I don't tend to fill up notebooks very often.
