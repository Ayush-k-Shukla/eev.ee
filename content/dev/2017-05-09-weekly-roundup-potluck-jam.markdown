Oh hey I did a bunch of stuff.

- **patreon**: I wrote the usual [monthly update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/may-prologue-9768745) and posted [my progress so far on my book](https://www.patreon.com/posts/4-book-so-far-9906504) for $4 patrons.  Also I meticulously tagged all my old posts for some reason, so I guess now you can find [photos of Pearl](https://www.patreon.com/eevee/posts?tag=pearl) if you want to?

- **blog**: I _finally_ fixed the [archives page](https://eev.ee/everything/archives/) to not be completely flooded by roundups, and added a link to it, which has been missing since the last theme refresh ages ago.  Also updated the sidebar to match the front page.

- **flora**: I hastily cobbled together a [species sheet VN](http://floraverse.com/comic/seeds-war-is-hell/call-sign/613-bearrings-common/), the first new one in a year or so.

- **music**: I made [a song](https://soundcloud.com/lexyeevee/sparkle-magic).  It's okay.  It feels incomplete, probably because I got tired of working on it partway through and gave it a hasty ending.  Maybe I'll iterate on it sometime.  I also started mucking around with an attempt at contributing to the Flora [glitch album](https://twitter.com/glitchedpuppet/status/859881956988690432), but I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

- **potluck**: I came up with a weird idea: ask the general public for sprites, then make a game out of whatever I get.  I made [a tiny Flask thing for submitting tiles](https://c.eev.ee/tileset-potluck/) and the results so far are...  _weird_.  Nine days to go until I close tile submissions, if you want to give this a shot.

- **dev**: I fixed some mGBA bugs with multiple gamepads, woohoo.

- **art**: I did some doodling that wasn't too bad.  Mostly I started trying to flesh out the fox flux tileset, which is proving more difficult than expected.

I have some Patreon obligations I oughta get to sooner rather than later; I should _probably_ get a skeleton engine ready for the potluck game, whatever it ends up being; and I'd like to get some more book work done.  But at the moment I'm mostly practicing art and trying to make tiles, since the art is going to be the major blocker for expanding fox flux into a somewhat bigger game.
