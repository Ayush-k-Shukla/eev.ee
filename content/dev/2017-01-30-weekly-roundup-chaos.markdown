I feel a little bit like life is disintegrating into chaos, but I'm plowing ahead nonetheless.

- **isaac**: I finished porting NEON PHASE changes over to the Isaac's Descent codebase, which is great!  Now the only major blocker for a little tech demo is redoing the music (_argh_).

- **games**: I finally finished playing through all the games submitted to GAMES MADE QUICK??, which took an incredibly long time, oh no.  I dumped thoughts on the games in a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/822711806460207104), or you can [browse through them](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick/entries) yourself.  There's some pretty cool stuff in there, and I'm still amazed that much of it exists just because I said "hey let's make some video games".

It was such a smashing success that I also put together [Strawberry Jam](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam), a month-long game jam for making _horny games_, whatever that means.  (The concept is NSFW, but the landing page is not.)  I have two separate ideas I want to pursue, _plus_ Mel is doing their own game and will need my help to put it together, so I have a very busy month ahead.  We've both already started on the art for our respective games, and we've been doing some planning as well.

- **neon**: I fixed a bunch of bugs but didn't cut a new release yet, oops.  One or two are still lingering, and I don't want to make a ton of releases just for bugfixes.

  I wrote down "fixed %"?  What does that even mean?

- **art**: I tried drawing some things and they did not come out as well as I wanted.

- **veekun**: I did some _actual work_ â€” I have abilities ripped to YAML _and_ a script that successfully loads them into the database, and I've taken a stab at items.  I have no idea when this is going to get done, though; I've got a mountain of work to do in February.

- **blog**: I started redesigning and merging my projects page with the landing page for this domain to make a more useful index of work I've done.  Not happy with it yet, but it's getting somewhere, gradually.

Next month will be, well, video games.  A lot of video games.  Plus I have other time-critical stuff to do.  Plus I have other not-time-critical-but-really-needs-doing stuff to do.  Oh boy!
