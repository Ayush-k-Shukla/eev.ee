- **cc**: I did a lot of physics and a lot of tearing my hair out.  I changed ground detection to be based on collision, which opened the door to making slopes work, and clumsily hacked sliding into working.  Then I wasted two days banging my head against a wall and getting nowhere.

    (But spoilers for next week: I did get slopes working perfectly on Sunday.)

- **fox flux**: Focusing just on player sprites since the game is fundamentally not playable without them.  I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel; almost all of the walking sequences are done, and about half of the forms are more or less done.  So, like, 60% of the way there maybe?

- **veekun**: Loaded and fixed a bunch of little things that were missing, and now the site is basically functional.  Had to fix some more form ordering problems, little obscure connections we forget about with every game, and some issues with evolutions.  But I do have a website, and that's nice.  Ideally I'll have something worth publishing by the end of the month.

And, hm, that's all.  Looks like most of my week went to CC physics, which has me in a mood to work on my book again...  horf, so much to do.
