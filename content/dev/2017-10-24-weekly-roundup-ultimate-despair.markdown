Kind of a slow week, I guess.  We _did_ spend an awful lot of it playing Danganronpa V3.

- **fox flux**: Cleaning up the division between this game and the generic engine guts.  More work on the remaining protagonist sprites, including finally coming up with a "landing on the ground" animation I like.  Experimenting with shaders and game mechanics and whatnot.

- **cc**: Got that UI for editing a sprite animation to a mostly usable state.

- **art**: Kept up doodling most days, and even drew [something I like](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/921181739782774784).
