Hello!!  This is just the year of endless interruptions.  I switched medication and I'm _functional_, but I think I have withdrawal from going off the _old_ stuff, so I've been a little spacey for about a week.  Hoping it passes soon!  Also some other distractions happened.  But in the meantime I've been drawing a lot.

- **art**: I've been joining Ash's commission streams for the past week or so and mostly doodling porn, but after doing that for a while, I decided I should try coloring stuff again, so now I'm doing that also.  Definitely need the practice, but really enjoying seeing myself produce more finished work again.  I guess I could go put some of that work in the canonical place, too.

- **blog**: I did a _whole bunch of work_ on a blog post which is going to be preposterously long, but hey, what a way to come back.  Hoping to finish it by the end of the month, if I can get my brain working again.

- **alice**: Still writing for this...
