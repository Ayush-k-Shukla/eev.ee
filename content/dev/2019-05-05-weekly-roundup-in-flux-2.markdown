- **fox flux**: I'm not sure what happened but I mostly did fox flux this week!  It's kind of a huge mess at the moment â€” I have a thousand lines of uncommitted changes from a dozen different half-finished experimental ideas, which makes starting on a _new_ idea a bit daunting.  So I spent some time finishing up and committing about half of that stuff, and then...  um...  started a few new half-finished experimental ideas.  I am good at software development.

    I got a _bit_ lost in the weeds trying to make the physics of pushing blocks work a bit better, which I'd still like to do, but I think it might require completely rethinking how pushing works (mainly in order to avoid a two-pixel gap in some situations, sigh, but that kinda thing's important to me) and also redoing how friction and whatnot works.  I can't wait.

    Also been finishing up some visual effects I started ages ago but didn't quite figure out, filling in some missing pixel art (which I _think_ I got a little better + faster at), and fleshing out mechanics + trying out some new ones.  It turns out, if you think your game needs more mechanics, a good place to start is to _implement the existing ones_ so you can run around and play with them freely and see what new stuff comes to mind.  Who knew?

- **art**: I painted [a picture](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1124179449199468544).  Not porn, for once!  I'm definitely gonna do this more often; it was quicker and easier than I expected, and came out better too.

I missed working on fox flux and am glad to be doing it again, but I've clearly gotta balance my time across other stuff a bit better, too.
