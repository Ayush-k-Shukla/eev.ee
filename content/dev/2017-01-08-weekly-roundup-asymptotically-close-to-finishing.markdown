My sleep has been pretty weird, and I've had a few drowsy days lately, but I'm mostly keeping the momentum going.

- **art**: I made an effort to draw _something_ every day.  I drew a [January avatar](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/816357612308480000), doodled with some friends, made a weird pixel animation, and whipped up a quick [illustration](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/817881463379017728) for a [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick) I'm accidentally running.

- **music**: Sketched out a few phrases and studied Cave Story a little more.  I made a pretty decent start on a new remix of the Isaac background music, after some feedback from Mel.  I hacked it into the game, too, and hearing it while testing other stuff turns out to be a good way to find what needs improvement.

- **isaac**: Mostly implemented the stone doors, drew a credits Eevee, found a way to draw sprites inside text (sorta).  I think this just leaves the title/credits, music, and bugfixing.  So, so close.

- **veekun**: Cleaned up and committed some recent extraction work, but didn't make much new progress.

This week is [AGDQ](https://gamesdonequick.com/), which means I'm going to spend an awful lot of time watching people play video games instead of doing anything useful.  I was pretty unhappy about that last year, so this time I'm "running" a non-serious [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick) all about trying to make a game during that otherwise-lost time.
