Spoilers: I didn't finish the potluck game!  I think I bit off a little more than I could chew, since the game necessarily needs a bunch of mechanics and world to actually make use of all the tiles.  So I'll just...  keep working on it over time.  It'd be nice to finish by the end of the month, but suddenly I have far more stuff than before to be working on, so who knows anything.

- **potluck**: I made an inventory, added UI for it, implemented the other colors of locks, made several kinds of projectiles, implemented damage and recoil and i-frames, made a whole menu for customizing gamepad controls, rigged a convoluted thing that tries to adapt the UI to the style of gamepad you're using, implemented conveyor belts, and did a whole lot of planning.  But still, so far to go, sob.

- **fox flux**: Started touching up portraits from the first game while watching glip play Zelda.  Results thusfar are [promising](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/883960540250292224)!

- **chaos composer**: I have been drafted into working on glip's game, already in progress in Unity.  I just got ahold of the game thusfar, and I've never used Unity before, so I've mostly been giving myself a crash course by clicking stuff at random to see what happens.

I have no idea what I'll be doing this next week!  I have a _lot_ of things vying for my attention, and somehow the month is already one-third over.  I'd like to knock out some low-hanging fruit, so maybe I'll get blogging out of the way and try to finally finish veekun?
