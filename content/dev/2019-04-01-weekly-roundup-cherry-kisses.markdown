Hello hello!  I finally finished that game I was working on, so now I might actually be back to some sort of normal dev schedule.

Except I'm gonna be kinda occupied for the next week or so.  So.

- **cherry kisses**: Hey hey I finished making [Cherry Kisses](https://eevee.itch.io/cherry-kisses), which is **super duper NSFW**!  It's probably the most well-designed and polished thing I/we have released, though.  Whoops!  I gotta stop accidentally making sex games.

    There's some little niceties in there.  Maybe I should, like, write about it sometime.

    Also attempted to get it to work on Android, which...  is...  non-trivial, despite LÃ–VE being "able" to target Android.

- **particle wipe generator**: Cherry Kisses includes a cool heart transition between scenes, which took a surprising amount of effort to create, so I packaged up the code and put some dials and knobs on it.  Now you can use the [particle wipe generator](https://eevee.itch.io/particle-wipe-generator) to make your own particley transitions!  Also hosted [locally](https://c.eev.ee/particle-wipe-generator/).

    Maybe I should, like, write about how this works sometime.  Can't wait for someone to tell me how I could've done it a thousand times more easily.

- **irl**: We did some spring cleaning!  Very exciting for anyone who doesn't live here, I know.  Our bedroom is no longer half-full of half-unpacked boxes, which is pretty nice.

- **sudoku**: I occasionally waste time with a nice sudoku app, which has a free ad-supported version and a paid version.  It has a sequel now, which is even better, but which only comes free with ads.  I am incensed by this so I started writing my own JS player out of spite.  Unclear whether my spite will last long enough to produce something usable.

Pretty happy to be back to makin' things!  I love that I could spin off some throwaway helper code into a little gamedev tool, and I'd definitely like to do more of that sort of thing in the future.
