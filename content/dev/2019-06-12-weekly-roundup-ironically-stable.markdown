I remain on a fox flux kick.  Keep trying to do other stuff as well and then not doing that?  Hm.

- **fox flux**: Documented the hell out of all my rewritten collision code, removed some old hacks, put some methods on a new type that was an ad-hoc table before, and fixed a final remaining edge case in a satisfying way.  Did kinda start writing about all this but didn't finish it yet.

    Then I fixed all the stuff I'd broken about pushing in the process, and cleaned it up somewhat.

    Water is gradually improving but still kinda rough.

    Also added some experimental [candy](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1136650695623364610)?  Candy is pretty good.

    I did some more overhauling of the palette; I'm really really liking how it's coming out.

    And also a preposterous amount of brainstorming.  Like I've got half a dozen sheets of paper with tiny 8pt notes crammed on them.  This ought to be a fun game.

Welp, back to that, then.
