Busy week, including a friend's visiting, but most of my time went towards only two things:

- **veekun**: I got forms dumping (more or less), got moves dumping, spent a whole lot of time chasing down obscure little details, and wrote most of a yaml-to-sql importer for moves.  That all leaves me pretty heckin' close to having the core Sun and Moon stuff in the database.  Finally, the end is in sight.

- **blog**: I wrote [about level design]({filename}/2017-07-01-some-memorable-levels.markdown) by going over some levels in games that are memorable to me.

I'll be spending the next week working on the potluck game and watching SGDQ!
