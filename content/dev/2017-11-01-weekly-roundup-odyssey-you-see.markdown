Dammit, _another_ video game came out.

- **fox flux**: Some nitpicks to the landing frames, and copying them to every other form (augh).  Finished up another form entirely, hallelujah.  Very little left now.  I think last week is also when I pixeled out a few more experimental characters.

- **cc**: More sprite animation UI work, which is incredibly tedious oh my goodness.  I spent a day investigating Mecanim's suitability for sprite animation _again_, and ultimately concluded...  no.  Good use of time.

- **blog**: I, ah, _started on_ my final October post.  Should be done shortly.

- **art**: The doodling continues!  The best results are NSFW, alas, but I did make [this quick relatable comic](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/924427298022998016).  Also [this good face](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/925268278808780800).

- **writing**: I have begun work on a Twine.  Okay, well, last week I basically just wrote a bunch of custom JavaScript for it and zero actual prose, but it's still work.
