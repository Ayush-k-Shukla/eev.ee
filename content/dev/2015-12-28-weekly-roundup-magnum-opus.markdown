This month's theme is **game dev**, and the major project is my text adventure, **Runed Awakening**.

I may have ended up drawing for like half the week, by accident.

- **SLADE**: After having used it intensely for a while to write my Doom post, I spent most of a day fixing [a bunch of little papercuts](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/pull/369), plus (I hope) a crash someone experienced on OS X.  I also cobbled together some preliminary [support for 3D floors](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/issues/205#issuecomment-167007882), which will be _awesome_.

- **Flora**: Threw together a quick [cutscene](http://floraverse.com/comic/this-means-war/398-this-means-war-p14/).  I should really make an editor for these things so I don't have to keep doing it.  Maybe next month.

- **art**: Oh wow.  I spent the last three days of the week, pretty solidly, working on a single picture.  I have a collage of the best thing I drew every two weeks for the whole year, and it only has one final slot left, and I wanted it to be the best I could possibly muster, and I may have been a little ambitious.  It's still not done.  Almost.

- **Runed Awakening**: Made a couple breakthroughs, implemented some more Main Plot stuff, hurrah.  I don't think I'll have time this week to do any serious work on it, so it seems I didn't get mostly-done this month as I'd hoped.  I've cleared a lot of hurdles and laid a lot of groundwork, though, so I hope I can keep up the progress and have something worth showing by the end of January?

- **blog**: Workin' on parts 2 and 3 simultaneously.  Fixing SLADE stuff kind of got in the way.  I'm also having some kind of irritating driver problem that crashes SLADE at inopportune times, argh.
