- **cc**: I fixed an obscure timing issue and...  well, that's all, how exciting.

    I should really talk about this game more, but it's big and I'm not the one designing it and I don't have a good sense of how much we want to keep under wraps yet?

- **blog**: I wrote a stream of consciousness about how [Nazis are bad]({filename}/2017-08-13-nazis-are-bad.markdown).

- **potluck**: What?  Yes!  I worked on potluck a bit, believe it or not.  I've decided to try procedurally generating the whole game â€” something I've wanted to do for a while, and a decision that has piqued my interest in potluck considerably.  Step one was to clean up all my map code, which was entangled with parsing Tiled's JSON format, to make it actually _possible_ to generate a map.  I finally did that and made an [extremely basic proof of concept](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/897958456639893504) that just varies the floor height.

- **fox flux**: The usual brief work on player sprites.  The game has a lot of them.

- **gamedev**: I made a video game with glip again!  It was a birthday present for two of our friends, and it's extremely specific to them and basically incomprehensible to anyone else, so I haven't decided yet whether it'd be appropriate to release publicly.  But we made something pretty coherent on a whim in two and a half days and that's nice.

I'm currently working on veekun, which has _finally_ progressed to the point that it has data appearing within the website!  Hallelujah.  I expect there'll be plenty of stuff to clean up, but this is a tremendous leap forwards.  I'll be so glad to have this off my plate at last, argh.
