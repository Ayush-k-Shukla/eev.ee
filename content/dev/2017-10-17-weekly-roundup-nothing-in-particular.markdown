- **fox flux**: I'm taking a little time to clean up the guts of my "engine", which has now been copy-pasted between half a dozen games and moderately modified in all of them.

- **blog**: I wrote about [how I've gotten Unity to do 2D platforming]({filename}/2017-10-13-coaxing-2d-platforming-out-of-unity.markdown).

- **art**: Doodling.

- **misc**: Wrote half of a small Discord bot.  Started on a new small game.
