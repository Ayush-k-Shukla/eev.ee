August is loosely about **video games**, but really it's about [three big things in particular]({filename}2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown).

I accidentally went nocturnal again, which always leaves me exhausted for a couple days as atonement for _skipping an entire day_, so this week was a little less productive than the last two.

- **art**: Drew, just, a ridiculous amount of stuff.  Pages of sketches.  Several birthday gifts.  Even some serious attempts to learn from other artists' work.  Somehow I did zero "daily" Pok√©mon, though.

- **blog**: Wrote and published a quick lament about [attribution on the web]({filename}/2016-08-15-attribution-on-the-web.markdown).  Also finally put the article "summary" (the bit before the read-more link) in Twitter cards, so, that's nice.

- **book**: Decent progress?  Took a bunch more notes; converted a good chunk of my existing notes into real prose; rewrote the preface; cleaned up some aesthetic issues that had been bugging me.

- **hax**: I took a day to make a [ridiculous ROM hack](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/149188409247/i-made-opa-opa-a-video-game-for-his-birthday) for a friend's birthday.  Learned some neat things about the Game Boy along the way, though.

I count drawing as genuine useful work, since it's practicing a thing I'm trying to learn, so I still did a decent amount of stuff this week.  Just, ah, not too much of it was the Three Things.  My sleep seems to be mostly un-fucked now, so this next week should go a little better.  I _think_ I can still have decent progress to show on the three things, though maybe not quite everything I wanted.
