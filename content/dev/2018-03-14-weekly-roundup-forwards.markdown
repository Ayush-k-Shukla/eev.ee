- **art**: Did some doodles.  Not as frequently as I'd like, and mostly not published, but I did some, and that's nice.

- **alice**: Continuin' on, though mostly planning and tech stuff this week, not so much writing.

- **irl**: I did my taxes oh boy!

- **blog**: I made _decent progress_ on last month's posts, but, am still not done yet.  Sorry.  I only have so much energy I can pour into writing at a time, apparently, and working on a visual novel is eating up _tons_ of it.

- **anise**: We picked up progress on this game again, came up with a bunch more things to populate the world, and both did some sketches of them!  Also I did some basic [tile collision merging](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/972336925880107008), which I'd been meaning to do for a while, and which had promising results.

- **idchoppers**: I got arbitrary poly splitting _mostly_ working, finally...!  I can't believe how much effort this is taking, but it doesn't help that I'm only dedicating a couple hours at a time to it completely sporadically.  Maybe I'll have something to show for it soon.

The visual novel is eating most of my time lately, and I'm struggling to get back that writing momentum, and in the meantime it feels like it's consuming all my time and not letting me do anything else!  I'm getting there, though.
