Finally, 2016 is dead.  Good riddance.  I'm sure this year will be different, as though time were composed of discrete chunks with different moods.

- **isaac**: I set about moving a bit more hardcoded stuff into Tiled, which is better than nothing.  Fixed a few oddball physics bugs, like being able to walljump, which I'd somehow never noticed.  Made the inventory actually work correctly, and gave it a HUD.  Made the book mostly work.  Finished up the laser.  Spent far too much time drawing rock and brick tiles.

    It's not quite at the point of playing the original game as I'd hoped, but it's _reeeally_ close.

- **music**: Worked a little bit on a remix of the Isaac background music.

- **book**: Dicked around with Sphinx and LaTeX for hours instead of actually writing anything.  Did a teeny tiny bit of writing.

- **veekun**: I figured out how texture animations work, which is _incredible_ and makes my model viewer actually almost correct.  It still has some bugs and weirdness, and I haven't actually tried it on every single dang Pokémon yet, but this is looking extremely viable.

    I went a-hunting for more artwork, ended up writing a thing that just dumped every single image it could find in the entire game, and managed to dig up the bigger sprites used in the Pokédex.  Alas, naturally, only the Pokémon actually catchable in Sun and Moon have a big Pokédex sprite.

- **art**: I did some doodling in a vain attempt to remember how to draw.  Not sure if successful.  I got a couple scraps of concept art for Isaac HD out of it, though.

Despite how it sounds, I've actually had a lazy last few days, which has been a nice change after several solid weeks of plowing ahead at maximum speed.  Priorities remain the same as they have been.
