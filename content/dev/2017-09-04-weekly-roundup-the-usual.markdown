- **cc**: Slopes now work absolutely _beautifully_.

- **fox flux**: Many more player frames; there's still a little ways to go, but I've been making incredible progress.

- **veekun**: Wrote effect text for items and abilities, which was by far the most tedious thing remaining.  Perfected item and box sprites.  Not much left now.

- **art**: Doodled a bit?
