title: Weekly roundup: Slow catchup

Trying to catch up on stuff and also relax a bit, simultaneously, and the results are confusing.

- **blog**: I wrote a late sponsored post on [utopia]({filename}/2017-03-08-utopia.markdown).  Also some work on a couple others I have in mind.

- **idchoppers**: On a total whim, I started writing a WAD parsing and whatnot library in Rust, called [idchoppers](https://github.com/eevee/idchoppers).  It doesn't do a whole lot yet and it's kind of a mess while I figure out how to design types in Rust, but it's enough that I managed to [flip every map in Doom 2](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/840866324603527168) and [dump MAP01 to SVG](http://stuff.veekun.com/idchoppers-map01-v1.svg).

- **games**: I played a lot of Strawberry Jam games, and I think I'm still only halfway through, yikes.

I feel awake and decently-rested, but somehow still drained.  Oof.
