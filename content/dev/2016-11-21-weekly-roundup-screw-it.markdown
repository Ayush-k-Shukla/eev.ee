November is a disaster and I've given up on it.

- **runed awakening**: I found a decent DAG diagrammer and plotted out most of the puzzles and finally had visual confirmation that a few parts of the game are lacking.  Haven't yet figured out how to address that.

- **blog**: I finished an article for SitePoint.  Also I wrote [a thing about iteration]({filename}/2016-11-18-iteration-in-one-language-then-all-the-others.markdown).

- **veekun**: Playing Pokémon has made me interested in veekun work again, so I did some good ergonomic work on the YAML thing, which is starting to look like it might end up kind of sensible.

- **zdoom**: I had a peek at my zdoom-lua branch again, dug into object lifetime, and discovered a world of pain.

Everything is still distracting, _and_ Pokémon came out, so.
