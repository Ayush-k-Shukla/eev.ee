I skipped a week again because, surprise, I've been _mostly_ working on the same game...

- **art**: Actually been doing a bit of it!  I [painted a thing](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/975464640703479808) on a whim, and some misc sketches, a few of which I even [felt like posting](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/980278387120914432).

- **alice**: Finally kind of hit my stride here and wrote, um, a pretty good chunk of stuff.  Also played with extending the syntax a bit, and came up with a choice menu that hangs around while the dialogue continues.  Kinda cool, though I'm not totally sure what we'll use it for yet.

    Even with my figuring out how to accelerate, it's looking like we'll have to rush if we want to hit our promised date of June 9.  So we might delay that a little...  maybe even Kickstart some stretch goals?  I dunno, I'm leaving that all up to glip and just writing stuff.

- **writing**: While I'm at it, I actually picked up and worked on a Twine from ages ago.  Cool.

- **idchoppers**: Holy moly, it [actually works](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/977368032388378624).  The basics actually work, at least.  I can't believe how much effort this hecking took.

    I also tried to start putting together an actual map API, with mixed results.  And tried to figure out the maximum distance you can jump in Doom, which is surprisingly tricky?  Doom physics are super goofy.

- **blog**: I actually [published a post]({filename}/2018-03-30-a-geometric-rust-adventure.markdown), which is even tangentially about that idchoppers stuff!  Wow!  Maybe I'll do it again, even!

Huh, that almost makes it sound like I've been _busy_.
