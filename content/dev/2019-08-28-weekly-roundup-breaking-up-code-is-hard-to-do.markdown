- **irl**: I went to the dentist, which I think was the last of the errand backlog, hallelujah.

- **fox flux**: Continuing on from [last week]({filename}/dev/2019-08-19-weekly-roundup-chugging.markdown), I threw myself headfirst into this idea of splitting up base actor code.

    I tried it against [Isaac's Descent HD](https://www.patreon.com/posts/isaacs-descent-7970240) (my LÖVE port of [Isaac's Descent](https://eevee.itch.io/isaacs-descent) that I only ever released on Patreon), since it has a very small number of abilities and objects, and just went hog wild.

    The results have been promising!  Most of it went much more smoothly than I expected.  A little bit was much more horrible than I expected.  But within the space of a week I'd gotten a rough first attempt working, ported it to fox flux, and gotten the game...  um...  mostly limping along.  There's still some lingering fallout, and I haven't even _gotten_ to Lexy herself yet, but it seems like this will be an overall improvement.  I can even write tests now!  _Tests_!

    I also did some more work on the revamped Lexy sprites, but then my tablet broke — _again_ — so that came to a screeching halt.

- **blog**: I started on a _second_ post (without finishing the first, hm), or more specifically, I started on a complicated but very cool interactive doohickey to accompany the second post.  Very excited.  Should probably, like, finish one of them.

- **alice**: Planning, writing.
