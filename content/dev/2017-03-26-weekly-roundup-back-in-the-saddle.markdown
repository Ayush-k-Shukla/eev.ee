- **egg watch**: Our little PICO-8 toy became a little more of a game; we started coming up with and implementing mechanics.  And then we forgot about it, oops.  Or maybe _I_ forgot about it, since all the art is done, so the ball's pretty much 100% in my court now.

- **blog**: More work on some words.  Also, I wrote a post about [why I used LÖVE]({filename}/2017-03-23-why-love.markdown) for my recent vidyas.

- **adulting**: I did my taxes and realized that self-employment tax is completely flat, ignoring all deductions and exemptions and brackets and whatnot.  So that stung.  Whoops.

- **book**: Oh, hey, I'm writing one of those!  I finally sat down and wrote a new start of an outline and cranked out a good few thousand words.  It's coming along much better than the previous attempt, too.  Pretty happy about this.

- **pico8**: I was thinking about UI, and about the PICO-8, and realized the PICO-8 _console_ could be entirely reconstructed in LÖVE.  As a weird sort of experiment, I set about doing that.  I only spent a few hours on it across a couple days, and am not pursuing it all that seriously, but it's been [interesting to work on](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/844472512230703105).

- **art**: I actually spent a few hours on art almost every day this week, to great success.  Then I tried to make a 3D model for the first time for glip's birthday, to [not so great success](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/845735735114149888).

I am now _cruising_, which is great.  Alas I have jury duty in three days, which is extremely not great and will probably trainwreck my momentum again.
