Chugging along.

- **fox flux**: Touched up another critter, some more terrain, messing with a background, blah blah.

- **veekun**: Pokémon importing is _so close_.  I've hunted down how incense affects breeding (which was sort of pointless since there aren't any new incense), found shapes, dealt with evolution, and filled in a few other little things.  It even runs to completion now!  But I can't _fully_ import Pokémon until I import items — oops! — so I'm working on that now.

- **art**: Drew some ridiculous nonsense.

- **blog**: Been working on a post about datamining, since that's a thing I've been working on lately.

- **cc**: I think I basically spent two days squabbling with Unity Collab and the asset store.
