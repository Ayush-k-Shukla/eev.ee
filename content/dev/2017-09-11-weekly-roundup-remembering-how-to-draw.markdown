- **flora**: Put together a [visual novel update](http://floraverse.com/comic/seeds-war-is-hell/call-sign/666-subject-6/) for glip.

- **art**: Lots and lots of doodling, but ultimately not a lot to show for it.  There's a [Splatoon thing](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/906695016273240064) which came out okay.  Mostly just trying to get back into the habit, since I'm reeeally rough at the moment.

- **veekun**: [Updated](https://veekun.com/).  No biggie.

- **fox flux**: Asymptotically approaching having the dang player sprites done.  So close.

- **cc**: Got one-way platforms working _spectacularly_.
