- **blog**: I wrote about [introspection]({filename}/2017-05-28-introspection.markdown), or more specifically, what it's been like to gradually shift from "pure tech" to more creative work.

- **fox flux**: I am trapped in animation hell, but making progress.  I made a pretty cool new parallax background.  Also took a short break from drawing to do some physics, and now I have critters that can stop at ledges.

- **idchoppers**: I wrote a quick thing that counts texture usage in maps, by both count and area.
  
    Honestly, I've been avoiding idchoppers because getting the API right is going to be a good bit of tedious work, so if it's going to go anywhere then I'll need to devote some serious time to it.  Not sure whether I will or not.  Little cute tools like a texture count make for useful example cases for an API, though, so I guess this helps.

- **flora**: I did some _secret work_ for a not-yet-released thing.  It is _very good_.

- **art**: I drew a [June avatar](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/870431599636041728) which I am super happy with!

Mostly I've been doing _a lot of pixel art_, and I should maybe take a break from it for a little while, because I have _a lot of stuff to do_ this month.  Stay tuned.
