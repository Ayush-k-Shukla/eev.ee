Happy new year!  ðŸŽ†

In an unprecedented move, I did _one thing_ for an entire calendar week.  I say "unprecedented" but I guess the same thing happened with fox flux.  And NEON PHASE.  Hmm.  Sensing a pattern.  See if you can guess what the one thing was!

- **anise!!**: Wow!  It's Anise!  The game has come so far that I can't even believe that any of this was a _recent_ change.  I made monster AI vastly more sensible, added a boatload of mechanics, fleshed out more than half the map (and sketched out the rest), and _drew_ and implemented most of a menu with a number of excellent goodies.  Also, FINALLY (after a full year of daydreaming about it), eliminated the terrible "clock" structure I invented for collision detection, as well as cut down on a huge source of completely pointless allocations, which sped physics up in general by at least 10% and cut GC churn significantly.  Hooray!  And I've done even more just in the last day and a half.  Still a good bit of work left, but this game is gonna be fantastic.

- **art**: Oh right I tried drawing a picture but I didn't like it so I stopped.

I have some writing to catch up on â€” I have several things 80% written, but had to stop because I was just starting to get a cold and couldn't even tell if my own writing was sensible any more.  And then I had to work on a video game about my cat.  Sorry.  Actually, not sorry, video games about my cat are always top priority.  You knew what you were signing up for.
