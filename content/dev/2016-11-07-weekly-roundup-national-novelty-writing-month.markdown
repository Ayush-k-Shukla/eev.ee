Inktober is a distant memory.

Now it's time for NaNoWriMo!  Almost.  I don't have any immediate interest in writing a novel, but I _do_ have plenty of other stuff that needs writing — blog posts, my book, Runed Awakening, etc.  So I'm going to try to write 100,000 words this month, spread across _whatever_.

Rules:

1. I'm only measuring, like, _works_.  I'll count this page, as short as it is, because it's still a single self-contained thing that took some writing effort.  But no tweets or IRC or the like.

2. I'm counting with vim's <kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>C-g</kbd> _or_ `wc -w`, whichever is more convenient.  The former is easier for single files I edit in vim; the latter is easier for multiple files or stuff I edit outside of vim.

3. I'm making absolutely zero effort to distinguish between English text, code, comments, etc.; whatever the word count is, that's what it is.  So code snippets in the book will count, as will markup in blog posts.  Runed Awakening is a weird case, but I'm choosing to count it because it's inherently a text-based game, plus it's written in a prosaic language.  On the other hand, dialogue for Isaac HD does _not_ count, because it's a few bits of text in what is otherwise just a Lua codebase.

4. Only daily _net change_ counts.  This rule punishes me for editing, but that's the entire point of NaNoWriMo's focus on word count: to get something written rather than linger on a section forever and edit it to death.  I tend to do far too much of the latter.

    This rule already bit me on _day one_, where I made some significant progress on Runed Awakening but ended up with a net word count of -762 because it involved some serious refactoring.  Oops.  Turns out word-counting code is an even worse measure of productivity than line-counting code.

These rules are specifically crafted to nudge me into working a lot more on my book and Runed Awakening, those two things I'd hoped to get a lot further on in the last three months.  And unlike Inktober, blog posts _contribute_ towards my preposterous goal rather than being at odds with it.

With one week down, so far I'm at **+8077** words.  I got off to a pretty slow (negative, in fact) start, and then spent a day out of action from an ear infection, so I'm a bit behind.  Hoping I can still catch up as I get used to this whole "don't rewrite the same paragraph over and over for hours" approach.

- **art**: Last couple [ink drawings of Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon), hallelujah.  I made a [montage of them all](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/152588312702/this-is-a-daily-pok%C3%A9mon-milestone-so-heres), too.

    I drew Momo (the cat from [Google's Halloween doodle game](https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2016)) alongside Isaac and it [came out spectacularly well](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/152580526797/i-love-momo-i-also-love-isaac-it-seemed).

    I finally posted the [loophole commission](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/152621139382/sketch-found-a-clever-loophole-via-which-it-is).

    I posted a little "what type am I" meme on Twitter and [drew some of the interesting responses](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/794346667159891969).  I intended to draw a couple more, but then I got knocked on my ass and my brain stopped working.  I still might get back to them later.

- **blog**: I posted an [extremely thorough teardown of JavaScript]({filename}/2016-10-31-javascript-a-horror-story.markdown).  That might be cheating, but it's okay, because I love cheating.

    Wrote a whole lot about Java.

- **doom**: I did another speedmap.  I haven't released the last two yet; I want to do a couple more and release them as a set.

- **blog**: I wrote about [game accessibility]({filename}/2016-10-29-accessible-games.markdown), which touched on those speedmaps.

- **runed awakening**: I realized I didn't need all the complexity of (and fallout caused by) the dialogue extension I was using, so I ditched it in favor of something much simpler.  I cleaned up some stuff, fixed some stuff, improved some stuff, and started on some stuff.  You know.

- **book**: I'm working on the PICO-8 chapter, since I've actually finished the games it describes.  I'm having to speedily reconstruct the story of how I wrote Under Construction, which is interesting.  I hope it still comes out like a story and not a tutorial.

As for the [three big things]({filename}/dev/2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown), well, they sort of went down the drain.  I thought they might; I don't tend to be very good at sticking with the same thing for a long and contiguous block of time.  I'm still making steady progress on all of them, though, and I did some other interesting stuff in the last three months, so I'm satisfied regardless.

With November devoted almost exclusively to writing, I'm really hoping I can finally have a draft chapter of the book ready for Patreon by the end of the month.  That $4 tier has kinda been languishing, sorry.
