Uhhh I am having a hell of a time getting back in the saddle.  We had a friend visit, and I think he gave me his cold, and my cat is an asshole, and the dog ate my homework.

- **blog**: Some work on some words.

- **art**: I haven't _drawn_ in months.  I tried to do it a bit.  Results inconclusive.

- **games**: I spent a whole day powering through the last 20 or so Strawberry Jam games, just in time for voting to end!  Phew!  The [results](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam/results) (probably NSFW) are in, and, er, I won?  This didn't really occur to me as a thing that could happen and I feel a little guilty about it, hm.

- **gamedev**: I merged most of the later fox flux work back into Isaac's Descent HD, which I'm treating as a central repo for the engine guts I keep reusing.  I really, really need to sit down and split the engine stuff out cleanly so I don't have to keep cherry-picking stuff around, but I haven't had time yet.

    Also, Mel and I started working on a little PICO-8 toy in an attempt to get ourselves moving again.  It's coming along okay.

Spoilers for next week: I'm doing better this week, finally.  My sleep is still wrecked and I still have a cold, but I'm at least sorta doing things.
