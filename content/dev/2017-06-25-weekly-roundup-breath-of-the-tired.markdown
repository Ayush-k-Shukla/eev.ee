I _may_ have spoken too soon; I had some pretty sleepy nights this week.  Oh, well.  The slow march of progress continued nonetheless.  Also I played Zelda a lot.

- **potluck**: I built a few little mechanisms: platforms, keys, switches, etc.  I don't have much _game_ yet, but I'm putting off the bulk of it until GDQ week.  Hope I can actually do this game justice in just a week!  It'll be a different kind of experience, since the art is set in stone and I already have an engine that can do most of what I want; I just have to build levels and story.

- **book**: I churned out a good few thousand words, rewrote the introduction, and got rid of a ton of stuff from the old book concept.  It's actually presentable as a work in progress now!  Nice.

- **veekun**: I struggled with form ordering for quite a long time, but finally got it figured out, which is useful and important.  Getting there.  Also I had to yakshave my self-hosted git (which I use for ripped sprites), after an upgrade caused it to bitrot.

I did less than I would've liked, but I've still got some decent momentum on these three big things.  Still feeling pretty good, and eagerly looking forward to having time free in July to mess around with art and work on fox flux.
