Hey!  Miss these?  Great!  I'm doing them again and no one can stop me.

- **art**: I spent half the week rendering.  Something, something, joke about rendering and [EEVEE](https://code.blender.org/2018/03/eevee-f-a-q/).  No but really, I found out I'm kind of okay at this and set out to paint a whole lineup of all my [Floraverse](https://floraverse.com/) characters, which turned out to be really hard and time-consuming, but anyway here's [Lexy](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1090242006616424450) and [slightly weirder Lexy](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1089587238680162304) and [Cerise](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1090979132458979328).  Only, like, seven more to go.

    Hm.  If only I'd constructed some sort of [art website](https://t.eev.ee/) to put this kind of work on.  If…  only.

- **fox flux**: This game keeps plodding along.  I added a little blowing-a-kiss mechanic a while ago, and I finally gave it a [real animation](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1091443326518124544), which I then spruced up a bit more after recording that GIF.  Also been cleaning up a big mess of half-finished features I left for myself, including particle effects for—  well, that would spoil it!

- **strawberry jam**: I'm running [Strawberry Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam-3), the low-pressure month-long horny game jam!  I haven't gotten very far on my game yet, but most of the work is going to be upfront planning (I hope), so that's not too worrisome.  I just started writing code _today_, and hopefully will have some kinda rough skeleton done by the 25% point on Friday.

    This is gonna be most of my month!  What an exciting topic to come back to.

More coming down the pipe; I'm accelerating all the time.
