I'm burnt out.  I just can't get into anything.  _And_ I've been dealing with a huge stack of accumulated errands from last month.  And it's fucking hot in here and that just pisses me off all the time???

So I'm trying to step back and chill and draw and hang out with folks and whatever.  Sorry.  I don't know why I'm apologizing.

- **fox flux**: Added some sparkles to a key.

- **mario maker**: Made [Star Anise's Dream Land](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1146172591297581057) (5TQ-JG0-MNG), a happy-go-lucky level inspired by my cat, and [Koopa Valley](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1148839666491125762) (463-9CJ-PVG), an attempt at some standard friendly SMW-like fare.  Also made half of like six other levels, but I'm having trouble even finishing those.

- **art**: I've been drawing, just, a _bunch_ of porn.  It's nice to be getting back into that.  Drawing, I mean, not porn.  But porn too.

See you next week.
