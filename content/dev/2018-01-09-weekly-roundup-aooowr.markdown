- **anise!!**: Work continues!  glip is busy with a big Flora update, so I'm left to just do code things in the meantime.  I did some refactoring I'd been wanting to do for _months_ (splitting apart the "map" and the "world" and the scene that draws the world), drew some final-ish menu art (it looks _so good_), switched to a vastly more accurate way to integrate position, added a bunch of transitions that make the game feel way more polished, and drew some [pretty slick dialogue boxes](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/949464298832543744).  Nice!

    I'll be continuing to work on this game during [GAMES MADE QUICK??? 2.0](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-2), my jam for making games while watching AGDQ all week!  Maybe join if you're watching AGDQ all week!

- **art**: I tried drawing a picture and this time I [liked it](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/948334012925329408).  I also drew the [header art](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-2) for the aforementioned game jam, though I didn't have time to finish it, but I think I pulled off a deliberate-looking scratchy sketchy style that's appropriate for a game jam?  Sure we'll go with that.

- **blog**: I finished a post about [picking random numbers]({filename}/content/2018-01-02-random-with-care.markdown) _and_ a post about [how game physics cheat]({filename}/content/2018-01-06-physics-cheats.markdown).  Which, ah, catches me up for December!  Heck!  I think I've found a slightly more casual style that feels easier to get down, though?

- **writing**: I finally wrangled a sensible outline for a Twine I've been dragging my feet on, so now I don't have any excuses!  Oh no!
