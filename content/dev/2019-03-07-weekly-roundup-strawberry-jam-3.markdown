Another double feature.  Surprise, basically all I've been doing is working on a jam game.  Should be back to normal once I get this out the door.

- **art**: I doodled, like, once, but then was lost in gamedev all day every day.

- **cerise**: I finally, like, planned out the progression of the game, and sat down to write it.  Prose is harder for me than you'd think, and there've been a number of interruptions over the past month, so it's taking a little while.  I'm nearly done and am pretty happy with what I have so far, though.

    Actually, reading my notes here, I'm amazed how much of the game was done in only the last two weeks of February!  I didn't even have the passage of time working yet, and that's the most fundamental part of the game.

    I did also cobble together a thing for generating particle wipes, which I think is pretty cool; I'll probably write about it and release a web version in the near future.

Should be done in a day or two, but I've been saying that for a week, so who knows.
