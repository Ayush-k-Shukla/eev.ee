November is improving.

- **zdoom**: On a whim I went back to playing with my experiment of embedding Lua in ZDoom.  I tracked down a couple extremely subtle and frustrating bugs with the Lua binding library I was using, and I made it possible to define new actor classes from Lua and delay a script executed from a switch.  Those were two huge requirements, so that's pretty okay progress.

- **blog**: Zed Shaw said some appalling nonsense and I felt compelled to [correct it]({filename}/2016-11-23-a-rebuttal-for-python-3.markdown).  I also wrote about some of the [interesting issues]({filename}/2016-11-26-embedding-lua-in-zdoom.markdown) with that whole Lua-in-ZDoom thing.  I have a final post half-done as well.

- **art**: I did a few pixels, which you may or not be seeing in the near future.

Mostly writing and Pok√©mon, then.  But I'm clearing my plate behind the scenes.  Stuff's a-brewin'.
