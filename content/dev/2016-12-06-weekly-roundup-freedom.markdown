- **zdoom**: On a total whim, I resurrected half of an old branch that puts sloped 3D floors in the software renderer.  It kinda draws them, but with no textures.

- **blog**: I wrote a thing about [not copying C]({filename}/2016-12-01-lets-stop-copying-c.markdown) which was surprisingly popular.

- **sylph**: I accidentally spent 45 minutes writing a microscopic parser for a language that can only print string literals.

- **patreon**: I finished up some revamping of my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/eevee) â€” the wall of text is now a short and straightforward stack of images, and I dropped the blogging milestones.  I'm no longer obliged to write X posts per month, huzzah.

- **art**: I pixel-drew some new veekun version icons, which may or may not go live.  Also drew a December avatar.

- **veekun**: I got started on adapting my ORAS dumping code for Sun and Moon, and have box and dex sprites 90% dumped.  Text is mostly done as well.

- **art**: I did a few pixels, which you may or not be seeing in the near future.

veekun effort continues (as I scramble to actually finish the game so I don't spoil myself).  Also trying to, uh, remember how to draw?
