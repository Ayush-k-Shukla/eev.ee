Onwards!

- **flora**: I wrote [another twine](http://floraverse.com/comic/oneshots/573-state-of-emergency/) for Flora.

- **music**: I spent a day with MilkyTracker and managed to produce a remixed [title theme](https://soundcloud.com/lexyeevee/isaac-title) for Isaac's Descent HD!  It's not entirely terrible.

- **isaac**: I redid all the sound effects, slapped together a title screen, fixed a _ton_ of bugs, added a trivial ending, and _finally_ released a [demo](https://www.patreon.com/posts/isaacs-descent-7970240) on my $4 Patreon tier!  It's just a port of the original Isaac's Descent levels, so nothing particularly new or exciting, but I'm happy to see it in a more polished form.  And now that everything basically works, I'm free to experiment with puzzle mechanics.

- **neon**: I released [NEON PHASE](https://eevee.itch.io/neon-phase) 1.2, with a few [bugfixes](https://github.com/eevee/neon-phase/releases/tag/v1.2), most notably making the game not be glitchy as all hell when playing under fairly high framerates.

- **patreon**: I wrote the monthly [prologue](https://www.patreon.com/posts/february-7968737), which is just _so_ amazing, you can't even imagine.

- **games**: And then the latter half of the week went towards [Strawberry Jam](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam), my month-long horny game jam.  I'm churning out art for a puzzle-platformer (surprise), while Mel is doing something more story-driven (surprise), and we're both helping each other out.  Rate of progress seems okay so far, but I do have to put together two games in only a month, and I've still got a couple other looming obligations as well.  Fingers crossed.

    I'm tweeting bits of progress in a thread on my [secret porn account](https://twitter.com/squishfox/status/826733159886704640).

Next few weeks will largely be, well, work on video games!
