- **art**: I bought a tablet — like, [one with a screen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LFV5SI6/), not a graphics tablet.  But it's _also_ a graphics tablet, with Wacom pen pressure and everything.  So now I can draw in bed, and have been doing some of that.  Results are [mixed](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/854021115777228800); drawing on a screen is pretty weird, and undo is not as readily accessible.

    I continued touching up my [Lexy sprite](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/853165771266039812) from Isaac's Descent — working on the walk cycle now.  Not the most exciting work, but it looks much better.

    I also drew a [snake sipping coffee](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/854642215624220672), for reasons.

- **book**: I finally got through collision detection and some physics.  This thing is really coming along now, and it's cool to see it develop!  I doubt I'll finish the first chapter this month, alas — turns out there is a whole lot of groundwork to lay even for my tiny baby first game.

- **blog**: Finalized a Sitepoint article.  Did some more work on a new homepage, which is finally nearing completion, I hope.

- **spline**: Wow, haven't touched _this_ in a while.  Started implementing editing things, because glip has needed that for forever.  Didn't finish.

- **lunar depot 38**: I participated in [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38)!  This time I teamed up with [glip](http://glitchedpuppet.com/) to do the Jam, so we spent three days scrambling to make a game together.  (Spoilers for next week's roundup: the game is [Lunar Depot 38](https://eevee.itch.io/lunar-depot-38).)
