September is continuing the [three big things in particular]({filename}2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown).

I had a drowsy day, but otherwise it was still an alright week.

- **blog**: I published a [post about music theory]({filename}/2016-09-15-music-theory-for-nerds.markdown), which I oughta update to factor in all the stuff people have told me in the aftermath.  I also wrote half of another post and stubbed out one or two more; just gotta finish some of them.

- **runed awakening**: I did, er, the tiniest bit of planning, and then got distracted by music and game things for the rest of the week.

- **isaac's descent hd**: Physics is _done_.  For real.  I mean it.  It works, and it works so good.  It also has some tiny hints of gameplay now!  I'm close to having the first puzzle room be playable: the switch works, the bridge appears and becomes blocking, and the spikes kill you.  Just need to make the staff work and finish up the death handling.

- **music**: I toyed with Renoise and LMMS, ultimately deciding I like LMMS more.  I managed to make a decent chunk of a song that I actually _like_ and that would work remarkably well as background music for Isaac's Descent.

    And then LMMS crashed.

    I also dug out and cleaned off our keyboard, which had been buried in a closet somewhere for years.  I taught myself to play the Pokémon Center theme!

- **veekun**: I cleaned up some of the multi-version handling for this harebrained YAML concept.  Also dug into ORAS encounters and got 90% of the way to actually extracting them.

I said last week that I'd dedicate a few days to writing, and I would still like to do that!  Now is probably a good time to start.  I'm behind on blog posts for the month, and I desperately want to get some momentum going with Runed Awakening again.

veekun is definitely not on schedule, _but_ I'm getting excited and ambitious about working on it again, which is a really good sign.  I don't know how far along it'll be when Sun and Moon come out, but that's probably okay; veekun has always been a quiet technical resource, not a walkthrough.  I think I'm going to try focusing on that idea in the future — for example, I'm probably at the point that I could create orthographic projections of all the maps.

I haven't written anything for the book in a little while now, but it's looking like Isaac's Descent HD will be the final chapter, so working on it still counts as working on the book.  Right?
