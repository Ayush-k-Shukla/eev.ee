September is continuing the [three big things in particular]({filename}2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown)...?

- **music**: I tried to reconstitute some of the song I lost last week.  It wasn't as good.

- **isaac's descent hd**: I implemented death, an inventory, and the staff, cleaning up some stuff as I went.  The first room is now playable!

- **blog**: I wrote and published [a post about the `switch` statement]({filename}/2016-09-18-the-curious-case-of-the-switch-statement.markdown), made some fixes to a few recent posts, and worked on something about MegaZeux that I hope to finish today.

- **art**: I doodled for the first time in kind of a while, including some semi-private streaming, which was nice.  I did two [daily Pok√©mon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon) for the first time in a month, and they came out a little better than the previous ones.  I drew an [Eevee walk cycle](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/150852526792/i-needed-to-figure-out-how-to-do-a-digitigrade) as practice for doing the same thing as pixel art for Isaac's Descent, and it turned out surprisingly well!  Also worked a bit on a secret thing for someone.

- **veekun**: I got 90% of the way to getting ORAS encounters, after hitting quite a few bumps in the road along the way.  It's a shame this has taken so long...  and still isn't _quite_ done.

- **doom**: I started on a vanilla Sandy tribute map on a whim.

Last week of the month and I feel preposterously behind on _everything_, even though my working-to-goofing-off ratio has remained consistently higher than it's been in years.  Argh.  So it goes, I guess.
