Hello, hello!  It's been a while.  June ended up being an avalanche of errands and personal problems that neatly segued into each other, over and over.  Good times!  I _think_ everything's settled down now, but who knows.

Anyway, that gives us _three_ weeks to catch up on:

- **fox flux**: Finished and committed a bunch of half-implemented ideas in an attempt to get git clean for once (still more to go though); took a crack at porting sound effects from MilkyTracker and sfxr to Sunvox, which was much harder than expected; experimented with a nighttime palette; drew some new vastly improved swimming sprites from scratch.

    Did some work on the [camera](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1138604995564036097), which has always been pretty lazy.  (I've improved it a lot since that recording, so don't judge it too harshly.)  Started on a redone [menu](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1139930999792517123), which should be a great improvement over the demo's menu which was just "resume" and "quit".  Redrew the base dialogue portraits, and they look fantastic, but apparently I never tweeted about that, but you can see it in the next link!

    After spending all this time on miscellaneous mechanics and other bits and pieces, I decided it was finally time to get a basic gameplay loop going â€” enter a level, get some stuff, leave the level.  The results are extremely rough, but I've [made a start](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1144765161733013506)!  It's turning into a game!  Which is weird because it was already a game once!

- **secret game engine thing**: _Not a lot_, but I've cleared some design roadblocks that were seriously getting in the way.

- **art**: Some [doodles](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1139949731260620801).  Also I drew some [beautiful gift art](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1143762697751633920) for my and Ash's Metapodth anniversary.

- **alice's day off**: Wrote some stuff!  It's a miracle.

Currently attempting to get my ass back in gear, with moderate success.
