- **art**: Doodled some expressions and an action pose or two.  Ended up spending a day or two finishing [this little beach picture](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/907769372579586048) ([tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/165278162487)) with probably the best background I've ever produced?  So that's nice.

- **stream**: I started streaming Oracle of Ages in two-to-three-hour chunks, on a whim.

- **writing**: I did a little bit.  Dipped my toe in the water, I guess.

- **fox flux**: Still approaching finishing the protagonist, which I've been avoiding showing because it's interesting spoilers, but god damn it's annoying not being able to even show what I'm doing.  Anyway I'm _really close_ and then I can start building, like, the game.

- **cc**: Stubbed out a scheme for moving between rooms, though it's not quite usable on maps yet.  Implemented one-way platforms.  Finally finished splitting player input out of the player actor code.  Gave up on finding any other way to do it and started writing my own GUI for defining sprite animations.

I seem to have spent the last few days fighting with obscure tech issues, which is getting pretty frustating, but it happened _this_ week so it doesn't count for the purposes of this post.

Other than that, I'm making steady progress on...  stuff.  Just not nearly as fast as I'd like.  Never as fast as I'd like.  Never enough time in the day, I guess.
