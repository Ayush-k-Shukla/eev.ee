September is continuing the [three big things in particular]({filename}2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown).

- **gamedev**: I spent far too much time just trying to get collision detection working how I want in LÃ–VE.  Seriously, four or five solid days.  I guess I learned some _things_, which I will probably write about soon, but I also can't help but feel like I wasted a good chunk of time.  At least I'll never have to do this again, right?  Ha, ha.

- **music**: I found a tracker I kinda like and tinkered with it and LMMS a bit.  I'm terribly unconfident about this and don't even know where to start, so it's kinda slow going.  On the other hand, I finally grasped the basics of Western music theory, so that's nice.

- **blog**: I started on, uh, four different posts.  I'm good for the month on topics, at least.

- **art**: I doodled a bunch while catching up on podcasts.  Also I drew [a new avatar](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/774744694941028352), which I hadn't done since...  June?  Yikes.  This one was painted, too; all the previous ones had separate lineart.

- **veekun**: I taught my code to dump all of Gen I at once, cleaned up a bunch of text handling, and successfully extracted flavor text.

I'm not thrilled about the time lost to platformer physics, but oh well.  I'm a tad burned out on gamedev after that, so I think I'll dedicate the next couple days to writing and maybe catching up on veekun.
