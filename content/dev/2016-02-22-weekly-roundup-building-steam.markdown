February's theme is **writing**, and the major project is, er, a **book**.

I haven't actually written a single word of a book?  But oh dang I had one solid-ass week.  I've been nocturnal for a few days and it's been working pretty well.

- **art**: Did a ton of doodlin' practice.  I think I've finally hit a point where I can sketch something and have a decent chance of getting it sort of right, which is _amazing_, and a confidence boost as well.  I ended up crafting a brand new [Twitter banner](https://twitter.com/eevee), which is absolutely gorgeous.

- **Runed Awakening**: I built out several areas, fixed up a central critical puzzle, and had a lot of ideas for plugging together things I already had.  I'm being vague, so that doesn't sound like a lot, but it was a pretty big step forwards.

- **blog**: I intended to write about abuse and harassment, and it sort of morphed into [offense in general](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/02/15/everyones-offended-these-days/), but it seemed to resonate.  _Also_ I wrote about [Twitter's weird collection of subtle features](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/02/20/twitters-missing-manual/), and I'm still getting suggestions for edits.  _Also also_ I switched the site to pretty solid https, which turns out to be pretty easy with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/howitworks/).
