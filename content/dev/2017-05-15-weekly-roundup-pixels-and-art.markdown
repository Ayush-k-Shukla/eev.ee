- **fox flux**: I spent a preposterous amount of time spriting, and somehow came out the other end with like...  five more sprites.  I'm having a tough time designing abstract tiles, too.  This is going to take forever.

- **game boy hackery**: Pokémon Red and Blue didn't have unique small sprites for every Pokémon in your party list; instead there were half a dozen general shapes like "generic insect" and "generic snake".

    A [full custom set](https://twitter.com/emimonserrate/status/861218520184623105) of icons in that style, by Emi Monserrate, floated past my radar a week ago.

    It seemed like an obvious and interesting challenge to try putting those sprites in the games.  [So I did](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/861521744669974528).

- **art**: I doodled, just, a whole bunch of stuff.  Some of it was okay!  I oughta produce some actual finished work sometime, for real.

- **blog**: I got rid of the Disqus ads.  Sorry about that.

- **potluck**: You may recall that I'm doing [**TILESET POTLUCK**](https://c.eev.ee/tileset-potluck/), a project where people contribute tiles (without being able to see what's been submitted so far) and I make a game out of whatever I get.  This week I got a jump on the actual game by spending a day making a tiny baby environment with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), which seems pretty neat so far.

- **flora**: I wrote a third of a short story as a way to get myself jumpstarted on writing, since I still have a bunch of it to do this month.  Then I went to bed, so, not sure how well that worked.

- **stream**: I streamed the middle third of Doom II The Way id Did.  Very exciting.

Still have infinite art to do, but I'm starting to get somewhere.  Really need to get started on some writing, so I'm gonna go do that now.
