I seem to be sick!  Again?  All of my cycles are devoted to antivirus.  Please forgive my brevity.

- **art**: Did some final toodling around in Blender and made myself a really bad ironic 90s avatar out of my Eevee model.  Speedpainted a rainy view out my window.  Doodled or whatever.

- **games**: Streamed Eternal Doom and some other stuff a few times, for probably far too long, but whatever it's fun.  Played through Axiom Verge, which has gotten some gears a-turning.

- **blog**: Spent probably more than half the week working on a post for Sitepoint, plus a bit of work on another about fox flux, neither of which are published yet.
