I accidentally went nocturnal again, so I spent much of the week in a tired daze, which I'm not really very happy about.

- **lunar depot 38**: I _finally_ fixed both of the bizarre graphical bugs some people were seeing in [Lunar Depot 38](https://eevee.itch.io/lunar-depot-38), so if you were one of those people, feel free to give it a try again!  The problems were, alas, just some unsatisfying shader bugs.

    Oh, and the Ludum Dare judging is finally over; we came in [204th](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/lunar-depot-38).  Hooray!

- **fox flux**: Spent most of the week on pixel art.  I say "on", but a lot of that time was spent staring at the screen not really sure what to do next.  Learning how to squeeze new ideas out of my brain is...  really hard.  I did a decently complex animation and a few new kinds of terrain, though, so I guess that's tangible progress.

- **potluck**: The potluck is over, and I've assembled the [full final spritesheet](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/865845152094461953).  Now I have to make a game that uses every single one of these tiles, and _only_ these tiles, somehow.

- **blog**: I started writing a little sample game for a blog post, then abandoned it and rewrote the post from scratch, so that was a good use of time.

Feel detached from the world (since I've mostly been up at night) and like I'm not making much progress on anything, which is, frustrating.
