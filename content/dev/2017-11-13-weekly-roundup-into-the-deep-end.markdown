- **cc**: UI thing I was doing is actually, usably done!  Hallelujah.  Now for more of it.

- **idchoppers**: I got in a surprise Rust mood and picked this up again.  I didn't get very far, mostly due to trying to coerce Rust into passing around interconnected pointers when it really didn't want to, but I did add a tiny stub of a CLI (which should make future additions a bit less messy) and started stubbing out a map type.

- **fox flux**: Some more player sprites, naturally.  But also, a bunch of stuff!  I drew and animated a [heart pickup thing](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/928341615395069952), with the intention that hearts are a little better spaced out and getting one is a bit more of an accomplishment.  I also figured out how to do palette translation in a shader, ultimately culminating in a cool palette-preserving [underwater effect](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/929550930806128640).  Oh, and I guess I implemented water.  And a bunch of new movement stuff.  And, yeah.
  
    I'm _so glad_ I'm finally doing game mechanics stuff — getting the art right is nice and all, but this is finally something new that I can _play_.  And show off, even!

- **doom**: I made a set of [Eevee mugshots](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/927951709036351489).  I don't know why.  Took about a day, and was pretty cool?  I might write a bit about it.

    I also streamed [Absolutely Killed](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/Ports/j-l/killed), a Doom 1 episode of "gimmick" maps that I enjoyed quite a lot!  The stream is [on Twitch](https://go.twitch.tv/videos/188929506), at least until they nuke it in a week or two, and I used my custom mugshot the whole time.

I did _not_ work on the final October blog post that I started on almost two weeks ago now; my bad.  I've had my head pretty solidly stuck on fox flux for like a week, now that I'm finally working on the game parts and now just fiddling with the same set of animations forever.  I've got a _lot_ of writing I want to do as well, so I'll try to get to that Real Soon™.
