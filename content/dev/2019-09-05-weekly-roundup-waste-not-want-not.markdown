Wee bit late, but I've been busy.

- **fox flux**: I wrote some push physics tests, now that it's possible to do that.  Removed some old obsolete garbage I've hated for like a year, hooray.  And then I got stuck in a horrible loop of coming up with a new idea for how to do pushing, realizing it won't work in some case, making a thousand notes, rinse and repeat.

    I can't even fall back to spriting, because my tablet broke!  Argh.

- **doom**: I made [WasteNot](https://eevee.itch.io/wastenot), a ridiculous ZDoom mod that tracks how much ammo/health/armor you lose by grabbing items when you're close to the max amount you can carry.  Also I put some Doom stuff on Itch and the landing page here.

Very exciting week.  I spent a lot of it exhausted, after rushing to invert my sleep schedule in not very much time.
