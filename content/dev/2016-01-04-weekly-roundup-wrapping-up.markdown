This month's theme was **game dev**, and the major project was my text adventure, **Runed Awakening**.

- **art**: More than half the week went, pretty solidly, towards my _magnum opus_, which was a [gigantic Christmas card](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/682504518278369280) I wanted to finish by the end of the year so I could stick it in this [art improvement grid](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/682508071935987712) which I should probably put here on my own gosh-darn website.  I spent the last two days of the week just doodling, to kind of de-stress from finishing this and the blog posts.  Also started doing [daily comics](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic) again, which is how I got started drawing one year ago.  Now they're a little more ambitious though.

- **blog**: I finished both [part 2](http://eev.ee/blog/2015/12/30/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-2/) and [part 3](http://eev.ee/blog/2015/12/31/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-3/) of the Doom series, the last with only minutes to spare!

- **SLADE**: Fixed a couple issues I ran across while writing the posts: some drawing errors I caused, a very obscure drawing error I didn't cause, and some helpful configuration of arg specials.  I also spruced up some less-than-helpful stuff on the ZDoom wiki.

Thus ends my first attempt at a theme month.  I sort of sabotaged myself twice here by biting off a bit too much: a huge 4096Ã—4096 painting that took a solid week to finish, and a series of articles that ended up preposterously long and also took a solid week.

So the major project, Runed Awakening, did not get quite as far as I would've liked.  It _did_ get much further than it would've if I hadn't decided to prioritize it, and I'm still jazzed to keep working on it, so I'll still call this a success.  This month will have a different theme and major project, but I'll keep chugging away on my game as well.  Wish me luck!
