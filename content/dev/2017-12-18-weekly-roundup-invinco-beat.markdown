I've been a bit all over the place!  And I'm starting to go nocturnal again, oh no.

- **art**: I started drawing a header image for my itch.io page, which for a year now has been barren, save for a promise that I would soon make it unbarren.

  I accidentally spent a good chunk of time toodling around with 3D modelling again, this time trying to aim for low-poly with pixel art textures.  I tried a couple things, but the biggest success by far was [Star Anise](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/942350121869615104).

- **anise!!**: Still not done, but asymptotically approaching done.  Most of the time has been going towards the map, which has been rearchitectued several times, and which is bigger and more complicated than anything we've done before.  Also did some regular old mechanical stuff, like doors and whatnot.

- **misc**: I had MegaZeux on the brain and wanted to try out the Web Audio API, so on a total whim I wrote a little [player for MegaZeux's SFX strings](https://c.eev.ee/mzx-sfx/).

- **???**: Ah!  Not ready to talk about this one yet.
