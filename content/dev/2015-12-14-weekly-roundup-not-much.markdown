This month's theme is **game dev**, and the major project is my text adventure, **Runed Awakening**.

I got knocked a bit off course by accidentally watching some Discworld specials and sleeping through all of Saturday because my cat is a jerk.  I'm hoping that writing this now will help nudge me back into a more productive mindset.

- **Runed Awakening**: Made some huge improvements to AI, which is surprisingly tricky, so I'm always happy when it works out.  Fleshed out more stuff in the start area, started adding some tester amenities, and fixed bunches of bugs.  There's some more to do with what I have, but I'm currently a bit blocked on planning out the _middle_ of the game, which I want to have some intertwining side stories.  So I did a lot of thinking without necessarily making much progress, which is annoying.  Hoping to get closer in the next few days.

    The game is pretty story-driven, being a text-based game, but it's also a pretty shallow story â€” neither the player nor the universe are in imminent danger or anything nearly so dramatic.  I considered trying to make it a little heavier at the end, but I think that would feel pretty tacked-on.  I'd rather try to get this out sooner and do something bigger for a second game.  I just hope people enjoy this one?  I realize I've never actually _published_ a creative work, so I've been anxious on and off.

- **art**: I drew a [Delibird](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/674772137052258306) and it's okay though I'm still not happy with the way I do outlines.  Also [this Friskeon](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/675235344854421505).  And a lot of doodling.  I think I've managed to draw for at least an hour every day this week, which I'd like to keep up.  Still frustrated, though; I'm painfully aware that I only know how to draw a few body shapes in a few general poses, and I'm trying to branch out from that, and it's all stuff I've never tried before so it comes out awful.  So it goes.

- **music**: Something I want to learn how to do.  I toyed around with LMMS a bit and made a few notes that aren't entirely terrible.  A huge problem here is that even if I think of something I like, I can't transcribe it correctly, and after hearing the wrong thing a few times I've forgotten what the original thought was.  Next time I give this a shot I might just practice transcribing tunes I already know very well, like Zelda melodies.

- **spline**: Fixed some fallout from CSRF protection, whoops.

- **flora**: Mel wants to design a card game, and I've been helping plan that.

- **blog**: Worked on this month's posts some, but I hate everything I wrote and will probably delete most of it.  We're halfway through the month already so I really need to get these done, ugh.
