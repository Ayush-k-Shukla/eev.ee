Doin' game stuff.  Probably going to be quiet for a few weeks still.

- **alice**: Actually wrote a decent amount of stuff, though fairly haphazardly.  Finally kind of getting into the groove here.  Still contemplating more interesting ways to offer choices, without turning the game into a combinatorial explosion.

- **art**: Did some doodles.  Not as frequently as I'd like, and mostly not published, but I did some, and that's nice.

- **fox flux**: Revisited the parallax forest background briefly.  Made some progress, but talked to glip and maybe it's not the right approach in the first place?  Not thinking about it too seriously right now, regardless.

- **idchoppers**: Miraculously, I got multi-polygon splitting finally working...  and then hit a panic when there are coincident segments, which offhand I'm not sure how to fix.  Sigh.

Way behind on blogging, I know, sorry.
