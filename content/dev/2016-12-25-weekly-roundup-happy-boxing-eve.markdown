- **veekun**: I worked on extracting and viewing Pok√©mon models.

    That's it.  That's all I did all week.  I got _rather into it_.  (I guess I also worked on some Sun/Moon dumping, but that wasn't very exciting.)

    I've put it on hold for now, but after a solid 8 or 9 days of work, the [results so far](http://stuff.veekun.com/veekun-model-viewer/) are pretty dang cool.  I absorbed a whole lot of stuff about 3D, too.

See you next year!
