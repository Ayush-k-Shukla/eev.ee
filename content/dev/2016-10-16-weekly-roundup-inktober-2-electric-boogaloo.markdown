The death march of Inktober continued.

- **art**: Another batch of [ink drawings of Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon).  I earned myself a third grey Copic.  I also ran the light grey one _dry_, somehow, so I ordered a refill...  and while I was at it, ordered a fountain pen at Mel's behest.

    I painted a couple things, which came out surprisingly less bad than I thought; [one to cheer up some pals](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/151627609627/some-egg-friends-who-may-need-a-little-cheering-up) and [one emulating](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/151720344217/i-tried-to-reproduce-some-fine-glip-artwork-from) some [old art of Mel's](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/786065394683547652).

    I also drew some [ridiculous](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/785303292834263041) [nonsense](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/785906757335855104).

    I went through my collection of sketchbooks, many of which were impulse purchases from before I was even trying to draw (just because I like fresh paper) and are completely blank.  I found a couple with very old art in them, which was interesting and embarrassing.  I found out I can [doodle on paper much better than I thought](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/787851843313410048), so I'll probably be doing that more.

- **blog**: I finished and published [a post about Doom's weird sense of scale]({filename}/2016-10-10-doom-scale.markdown).  Halfway through the month and I'm caught up, so now I only have to do the normal amount of work in half the time, while also drawing a lot.  Er, whoops.

- **veekun**: I got about halfway through matching up ORAS's encounters, which is an incredibly tedious manual process.  I nudged magical into updating Global Link art and I finally fixed up the new code for grabbing box icons, so veekun finally has icons for every single Pokémon and not a bunch of embarrassing 404s everywhere.

    I also made veekun entirely HTTPS.  The upside of Let's Encrypt's short expiration time (and my laziness in writing a cronjob to renew all my certs) is that every three months I'm suddenly inclined to go comb through a bunch of nginx configuration and spruce it up a bit.

- **isaac hd**: I'd already hacked in some temporary dialogue code, but I spent half a day cleaning it up and turning it into something resembling a real feature.  I fixed a lot of limitations that weren't obvious just from looking at my previous example, such as "it can't show more than one line of dialogue".  The [results](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/786830239452180480) are encouraging!

- **irl**: Some personal stuff consumed a bit of time.

I've apparently gotten faster at the ink drawings!  I'm still a bit behind on writing, but I have some ideas for shorter posts relevant to stuff I've been doing lately.  I have so much to do, but actively trying to do it all is gradually making me faster at doing it, which is nice.

Since November is NaNoWriMo, I'm thinking I might use it as a real writing catch-up month, like this has been an art practice month.  I'm not working on a novel, of course, but I do have several prosaic things in progress: a book, Runed Awakening, some other fiction ideas, and of course this blog.  The usual goal is 50,000 words in 30 days, so maybe I'll try to write 2000 words every day?  "Do a bunch of things simultaneously" is certainly more my style than "do a single thing for an entire month".
