I see a light at the end of the tunnel...  it's...  it's the end of Inktober!  I'm so close...

- **art**: More [ink drawings of Pok√©mon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon).  I got a fountain pen and am still getting used to it.  I did a little doodling in the lost sketchbooks I found last week.

- **devops**: I upgraded `koiru` (machine that runs my IRC and some other small things) by, uh, two entire Ubuntu LTS releases, then spent hours fixing all the obscure stuff that broke.  Later I also fixed Munin, despite not really ever looking at the graphs, because I like graphs.

- **blog**: More note-taking and...  pivoting? for a special post.  Wrote and published a post about [word-wrapping dialogue boxes in games]({filename}/2016-10-20-word-wrapping-dialogue.markdown).  Wrote about half of a post about Inktober, which I should be publishing tonight, I hope?

- **doom**: I spent a couple hours dinking around with a secret `MAP31` idea I had.

I am so behind on writing that I might die.
