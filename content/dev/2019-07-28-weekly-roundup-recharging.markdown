Hello.  I'm kinda up and down but recovering, I think.

- **art**: I drew a bunch of porn, most of which is on my [porn gallery](https://d.eev.ee/) (warning: porn).  I even wrote some stuff, which will never see the light of day.

    I also finished putting all my 2015 art on my [clean gallery](https://t.eev.ee/), if you want to see the arc of my art journey, which slowed considerably after the first couple years.  Kinda bummed about that.

- **irl**: We have done so many fucking errands you have no idea.

- **gleam**: I put together another Floraverse VN, but more importantly (to me anyway?), I've actually made some inroads on making a little editor for these things.  It's not _entirely_ functional yet — did you know that drag-and-drop is a huge pain in the ass — but it resembles something and I'm making swift progress.  Hallelujah.

- **fox flux**: I gathered up like a dozen pages of dense notes and kinda consolidated them into one place, which is nice.

    I also, accidentally, uh, okay funny story, I was taking notes on paper and I doodled Lexy pulling a lever, and later I tried to sprite it based on her current sprite, and I didn't like it a lot, so I pixel-traced over the drawing instead, and it was way better, and this led me on a journey that ended up with a [completely different sprite design](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1153024196735188992).  It's a thousand times better in every possible way, but I've also invented a massive pile of work for myself, because now I have to redesign a dozen variants of her and redraw like 200 sprite frames.  It kind of feels like I'm back to square one and have accomplished nothing at all on this game, in fact!  But fuck me it's _so much better_

- **fox flux**: Documented the hell out of all my rewritten collision code, removed some old hacks, put some methods on a new type that was an ad-hoc table before, and fixed a final remaining edge case in a satisfying way.  Did kinda start writing about all this but didn't finish it yet.

Next week marks a fun milestone.  I'm now on the _very last page_ of the book I've been using to jot this stuff down, one week per page.  It spans almost four years.  I should probably find another one real quick.
