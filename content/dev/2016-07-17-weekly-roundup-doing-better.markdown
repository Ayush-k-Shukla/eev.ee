July is **themeless**.

I'm doing better!

- **art**: [Daily Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon) continue, perhaps a bit too sporadically to be called "daily" but whatever.  Also a [sunset painting](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/147219528422/lexyeevee-experimenting-i-made-a-minor) that came out really cool, damn.  And this [painting of a new Sun/Moon Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/147373740552/i-painted-a-thing-cut-for-sunmoon).  And a lot of other doodling.

    I've been trying out a bunch of Krita brushes, and I'm not _quite_ happy with any of them, but I'm getting enough of a feel for what I like to start making my own.

- **twitter**: I finally automated [@leafeon\_brands](https://twitter.com/leafeon_brands), my blocklist of advertisers.  It now automatically blocks ads shown to my primary account.

- **blog**: I wrote [some stuff about color](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/07/16/some-stuff-about-color/), which somehow took _way longer_ than I'd expected — I was hoping for a day or two, and it feels like it took most of the week.  That wraps up my June posts, so, er, I really gotta get moving on July.

- **book**: I had a book idea that seems to have a lot more staying power than the last one or two, and I did a bunch of research and planning for it.  I'll talk about it later, when I have something to show.

- **flora**: I was dragged into fixing shipping for the [Floraverse store](https://store.floraverse.com/), which thankfully mostly worked itself out before it became too much of a nightmare.

I'm working on _two_ posts at the moment, so I should be able to catch up soon.  As soon as I can, I want to find some blocks of time to experiment with art, work on Runed Awakening and this book idea, and spruce up veekun.
