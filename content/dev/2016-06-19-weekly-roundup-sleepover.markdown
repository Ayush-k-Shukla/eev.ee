June's theme is **clearing my plate**, a concept that becomes increasingly nebulous as time goes by.

I accidentally went nocturnal over the past week, which always leaves me completely fried for a few days due to losing a day.  So not the best week, but not the worst either.

- **art**: I drew a very quick [happy Minccino](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/742040728482676736) to try to cheer everyone up last weekend.  Their tail fluffs are upside-down.  Sorry.

    I drew and colored [two old friends](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/742726905909018624) on a whim, trying to apply some things Mel had told me about color harmony.  I think it came out as possibly one of the nicest things I've ever drawn, so, that's nice, whoa.

    I started drawing daily Pok√©mon (in a predetermined random order), where the only rule is a time limit of 30 minutes.  Here are [Wobbuffet](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743768142892015616) and [western Shellos](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/744170527074328577); I'll be dumping them all in [a Tumblr tag](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon) too.

    While I was out at lunch, I drew on paper for the first time in a while.  I should probably do it more, but [the results aren't too bad](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743923074383286272).

- **Runed Awakening**: Aha!  I pixelled an [NPC](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743082894030082050) or [two](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743526585567875072), possibly marking the first real character design I've ever done, as well as [an item](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743146980935798784) and [an attempt at a room illustration](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/743060257677578241).

    A couple friends played through the current state of the game, which led to a couple days of chasing down extremely obtuse minor bugs.  It's a little frustrating to have spent a lot of time and have so little to show for it, but one of the bugs was something that's plauged me for over a year, so I guess it at least fits with the theme of getting rid of looming things.  From here I should be able to get back to building things.

- **spline**: I _finally_ granted Mel the ability to create a new folder by themselves.  So far I've always done it manually, which has gotten increasingly painful since the folders use the nested set model.  There's still no UI for rearranging them, but this removes a huge source of...  requests for manual intervention.

- **veekun**: I started reabsorbing the current state of the new YAML schema and thinking about how to get it where I want.  Didn't make any actual progress, though.

    Working on getting the remaining images veekun is missing, too.

Probably more of the same this next week.  I want to make _huge_ inroads on Runed Awakening, fix the other category of things I have to do manually for spline, and get some work done on veekun one way or another.
