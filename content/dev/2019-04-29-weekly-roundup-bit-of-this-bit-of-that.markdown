I don't have a cool theme or pun this week!

- **irl**: I did a whole _bunch_ of errands, aggressively slashed my tab/email count, and went hiking.  Very exciting for you, I know.

- **secret thing**: I taught it to animate tiles and movement, and tried this out with a conveyor belt, which instantly threw a wrench in my whole plan.  Hm, well, I'll figure it out.  I wrote [about the concept for $4 patrons](https://www.patreon.com/posts/4-baz-game-26327386) (who will also be getting a bunch of beta builds when this is usable), if you're interested.

- **cherry kisses**: I have like four logic bugs reported by several different people, and they all _feel_ related, but they're also completely impossible.  Like there is no way any of these could've happened.  Except they did.  And I have no goddamn idea how.  I've spent like a day and a half wrestling with this and have barely made progress so far, but I would _really_ like to make the game not randomly crash for folks.

    At least it autosaves, I guess.

- **art**: I drew more things and I increasingly like them!  I don't know what happened, but I hit a point where I'm aggressively attacking all kinds of small details that I don't do quite right â€” details that, formerly, I'd just glaze over because it was hard enough getting the general pose right.  So that's good.

    Still working on categorizing old SFW art, too.  There's just a whole lot of it.

- **fox flux**: I picked this back up, but didn't actually make tangible progress until Sunday, but I'm listing it anyway to pad this list out a bit.

- **streaming**: Ash played through Doom II totally blind, while I provided commentary, which I guess doesn't make it _totally_ blind.  Anyway we have a whole [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe3hrqBmMcMIGp_8vhxD-F8Gs2ujRsvIM) of this nonsense now.

I'm juggling half a dozen things and am generally excited about all of them!  It's a nice way to feel.
