I was feeling pretty run down at the end of June.  I think I wore myself out a little bit.  DUMP 2, then Under Construction, then DUMP 3 (which I missed), and all the while fretting over Under Construction.

I took this past SGDQ week "off" and spent it mostly doodling.  I'm a bit better now!  I'm a post behind for June, a third of the way into July; don't worry, I'll catch up.

July doesn't have a theme.  I've got some stuff to do, and I'll do it.

- **art**: The 30-minute [daily Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon) continue, though not quite so "daily" for a bit there.  I also made a [quick birthday gift for a friend](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/146824297137/happy-birthday-riiko), spent a preposterous amount of time [painting a hypothetical evolution](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/146972945677/what-would-you-evolve-into-eevee-i-mean-im), and drew [an Extyrannomon for Extyrannomon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/147127566512/an-exty-for-exty).  Plus a lot of doodling.

    Oh, and I put together an [art more good chart](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/146980424262/hey-wow-its-been-another-six-months-so-heres) for the first half of this year.

- **zdoom**: My experiment with embedding Lua is a little cleaner — you can now embed a Lua script in a map and call it from a linedef (switch, etc.), making it slightly more of a real proof-of-concept.  I also did some research into how to serialize the entire state of the interpreter, for the sake of quicksaves.

- **gamedev**: I did a little more work on rainblob, the tiny PICO-8 platformer I started a month or so ago.  It now supports multiple "rooms" and has a couple simple intro puzzles.  I also wrote about 20% of a Tetris clone using pentominoes while watching SGDQ's Tetris runs.

- **veekun**: I gathered all of Bulbapedia's Sugimori art to replace the rather low-res and incomplete collection veekun has at the moment.  Not up yet, though.  I looked into the current state of extracting skeletal animations, yet again, and did not find any traces of success.  Alas.

Back to work this week, then!
