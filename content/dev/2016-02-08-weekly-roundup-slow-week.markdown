February's theme is **writing**, and the major project is a **book**.

- **spline**: Styled [Mel's personal site](http://glitchedpuppet.com/) and put it in production.  Did a lot of last-second oh-god-we're-in-production-and-nothing-works fixes, like throwing in Disqus and GA and fixing permissions and whatnot.

- **blog**: [I made pretzels!](http://eev.ee/blog/2016/01/31/i-made-pretzels/)  Also I wrote about making pretzels.  And about [writing](http://eev.ee/blog/2016/02/01/writing/).  And like two-thirds of a post about UI changes.

- **art**: [The usual](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic).  Also hourly comic day.

- **doom**: Some more tinkerting.  Made a few weapons that are pretty sweet.  Also made a little start of a ZDoom editing demo map.
