Getting back up to speed, finishing getting my computer back how it was, etc.  Also we got a SNES Classic _and_ Stardew Valley so, those have been things.  But between all that, I somehow found time to do a microscopic amount of actual work!

- **art**: Sketched some stuff!  It wasn't very good.  Need to do this more often.

- **fox flux**: _Finally_, after a [great many attempts](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/915960732013010944), I drew a [pixel art bush](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/915959946268700672) I'm fairly happy with.  And yet, I can already see ways to improve it!  But hey I'm learning stuff and that's really cool.  I've been working on a much larger pixel art forest background, too, which is proving a little harder to figure out.

- **blog**: After a long period of silence, I wrote about [how JavaScript has gotten a bit better lately]({filename}/2017-10-07-javascript-got-better-while-i-wasnt-looking.markdown).  More words to come, probably!

I've got some high aspirations for the month, so I'm gonna get to it and definitely _not_ go visit my video game chickens.
