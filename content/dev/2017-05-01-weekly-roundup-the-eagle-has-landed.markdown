- **lunar depot 38**: As previously mentioned, [glip](http://glitchedpuppet.com/) and I did [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38), producing a little tower-defense-y game called [Lunar Depot 38](https://eevee.itch.io/lunar-depot-38).  Judging is now open, so if you also did LD, feel free to [rate our game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/lunar-depot-38)!

- **fox flux**: I still want to extend this into a more finished game, so I've been working on that, mostly in the form of sprite work.  I spent at least half a month on the art for the jam version, and I suspect it's going to take even longer to get all the art done for the final.  Should be really good practice, at least?

- **blog**: I finally finished redoing [https://eev.ee/](this site's landing page)!  It's much easier on the eye than the old projects page, I think, and spreads focus around more sensibly.

- **etc**: The Internet was down for a day, and then I spent two days on a weekend trip with glip, so not much happened there.
