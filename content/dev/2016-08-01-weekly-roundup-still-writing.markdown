July is **themeless**, though in practice it's been mostly **blogging**.

- **irl**: Wow!  I did a bunch of errands and sifted through a bunch of email I'd been putting off.  Exciting.  Also I decided to take half an hour of server downtime for some upgrades right in the middle of the day because I'm bad at ops.

- **art**: [Daily Pokémon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon), of course.  I've now done [30 of these speedpaints](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/148082697972/just-hit-30-so-heres-a-celebratory-montage-i) (only 75% of daily, oh well), and there's some visible progress in there, which is pretty cool to see.  I also drew [an Eevee](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/148125683487/tried-to-take-some-inspiration-from-huiro) that attempted to take some inspiration from [huiro](http://huiro.tumblr.com/), a Japanese artist with a really simple style that I like.

- **blog**: I wrote about [naming]({filename}/2016-07-26-the-hardest-problem-in-computer-science.markdown).  I also spent _multiple days_ working on a pair of Python 3 posts.  I sure hope they get finished soon, but I guess you'll have to wait until the next weekly roundup to find out!

Oh boy that doesn't sound like a lot, but really, I spent so much time writing.  And playing Starbound.  But mostly, writing.  The Python 3 posts total about twenty thousand words!

After the mad dash to publish _six things_ in two and a half weeks, I'm all caught up on blogging.  I'll try to write some shorter and quicker things this month — I'm sure these massive tomes are as exhausting to read as they are to write — and spread them out a bit more evenly.

I have a bunch of stuff I want to make progress on in August, but I guess you'll have to wait and see what those are!  Hopefully I'll have something to show by next week, but if not, I'll quietly and shamefully pretend I wasn't ever going to do any of it anyway and playing Starbound for a week was my original plan all along.
