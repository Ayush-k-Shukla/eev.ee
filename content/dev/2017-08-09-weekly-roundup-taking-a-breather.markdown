Nothing too special about this week; it went a little slow, but that's been nice after the mad panic I was in at the end of July.

- **cc**: I'm getting the hang of Unity and forming an uneasy truce with C#.  Mostly did refactoring of some existing actor code, trying to move all the reading of controls to a single place so the rest of it can be reused for non-players.

- **fox flux**: I put some work into a new forest background, which is already just...  _hilariously_ better than the one from the original game.  Complex textures like leaves are one of my serious weak points, but this is forcing me to do it anyway and I'm slowly learning.

- **blog**: I finished that post on [Pok√©mon datamining]({filename}/2017-08-02-datamining-pokemon.markdown), which ended up extraordinarily long and slightly late.

- **veekun**: Dug into some missing stuff regarding items.

- **art**: Spent a day or two doodling.

Still behind by one blog post (oops), and slacked on veekun a bit, but I've still got momentum.
