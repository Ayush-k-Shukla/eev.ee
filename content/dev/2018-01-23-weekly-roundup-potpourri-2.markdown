- **blog**: I wrote a [birthday post]({filename}/2018-01-15-eevee-gained-2791-experience-points.markdown), as is tradition.  I _finally_ finished writing [Game Night 2]({filename}/2018-01-16-game-night-2-detention-viatoree-paletta.markdown), a full month after we actually played those games.

- **art**: I put together an [art improvement chart](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/953128089013297153) for last year, after skipping doing it in July, tut tut.  Kind of a weird rollercoaster!

    I worked a teeny bit on two one-off comics I guess but they aren't reeeally getting anywhere fast.  Comics are hard.

    I made a [banner for Strawberry Jam 2](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/954507232661577728) which I think came out fantastically!

- **games**: I _launched_ [Strawberry Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam-2), a month-long February game jam about making _horny games_.  I will probably be making a horny game for it.

- **idchoppers**: I took another crack at dilation.  Some meager progress, maybe.  I think I'm now porting bad academic C++ to Rust to get the algorithm I want, and I can't help but wonder if I could just make up something of my own faster than this.

- **fox flux**: I did a bunch of brainstorming and consolidated a bunch of notes from like four different places, which _feels_ like work but also _feels_ like it doesn't actually move the project forward.

- **anise!!**: Ah, yes, this fell a bit by the wayside.  Some map work, some attempts at a 3D effect for a particular thing without much luck (though I found a workaround in the last couple days).

- **computers**: I relieved myself of some 200 browser tabs, which feels fantastic, though I've since opened like 80 more.  Alas.  I also tried to put together a `firejail` profile for running mystery games from the internet, and I got like 90% of the way there, but it turns out there's basically no way to stop an X application from reading all keyboard input.

    (Yes, I know about that, and I tried it.  Yes, that too.)

I've got a small pile of little projects that are _vaguely urgent_, so as much as I'd love to bash my head against idchoppers for a solid week, I'm gonna _try_ to focus on getting a couple half-done things full-done.  And maybe try to find time for art regularly so I don't fall out of practice?  Huff puff.
