It was my birthday!  I need to write a birthday post argh.

- **anise!!**: Surprise!  Mostly Anise.  I refactored dialogue to be a _bit_ less of a hairball; started making item pickups actually work; decided to reverse a former decision and expand the world a little bit (which unfortunately means the world map doesn't _quite_ fit all on the screen at once, oh well); finally got around to making [_animated tiles_](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/951341833463808000) work (!!!); experimented with making sound effects in SunVox, with mixed success; and just general working on level design which takes incredibly far much longer than I ever expected.

- **misc**: I wrote a [userscript](https://c.eev.ee/userscripts/gdq-schedule-dimmer.user.js) to highlight the game being currently played at GDQ, though it's not quite so useful now that GDQ is over.

    I realize I don't really know where a tiny oneoff thing like this should _live_, and I've left a trail of a good few of them.  Hmm.  I guess I could've written a release post for it, but it also seems like it should be in an index of stuff somewhere...?

- **???**: ???
