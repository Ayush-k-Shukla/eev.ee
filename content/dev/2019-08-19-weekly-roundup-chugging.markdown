I'm discovering all kinds of ancient damage in myself, but I'm chugging along!

- **irl**: We're making our way through an endless backlog of errands.  There are so many.  But they're getting done, which is good!  Also the internet was out for a day so that was fun.

- **gleam**: It got a big ol' refactor, which left it working exactly the same, so that's fun!  Stubbed out enough features that it's now (technically...) possible to use it to make a VN from _scratch_, rather than just previewing and making minor edits to an existing one.  I split apart the player from the editor and ensured the player works standalone; I added a loading screen; and I finally got around to adding back music support.  It's coming along!

- **art**: I did like half a dozen daily comics?  You know.  "Daily".  The last one was...  oops, [almost a week ago](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1161879834416447493).  I'm sure I'll get back to them real soon now.

    Also some sketching!  I've almost filled a real physical sketchbook for only the second time in my life.

- **stream**: I took a crack at Sigil on UV, trying for 100% kills and secrets, with...  mixed results!  Great fun, I guess.

- **fox flux**: I am admittedly struggling a bit.

    We played Cadence of Hyrule; I found the art style inspiring; I tried to glean something from it that I could apply to my sprite work; and I realized basically everything I've drawn is counter to what I most like in pixel art.  It was a struggle just to produce the few tiles I have so far, so I don't know what to feel or do here.

    At Ash's suggestion, I started trying to draw some Dewclaw tiles, but boy!  That's difficult.  How do you design small pieces that can be put together into something sufficiently reminiscent of a city?  I don't even know how to _draw_ a city, not really; I'm remarkably terrible at filling in small details of a concrete place or situation.

    And then I tried to do something technical and split up Lexy's code — since historically it's been littered with a ton of `if self.form == 'foo' then ...` special cases — only to discover that it breaks everything.  Now I'm trying a different approach, which is not breaking everything quite as badly, but which has massive repercussions and possibly slows the game down by double-digit percent.  Love game development.

- **alice**: Still plodding along on Alice's Day Off.  I wrote a half-draft, half-outline of another route.  Just been hard to get in the right mood, lately.

- **blog**: I started on a post!  Wow!  Remember when I used to write posts?  I'd like to do that again.  I've got one half-done and ideas for a few more, if I can just get some momentum going again.

I'll get there.
