- **fox flux**: I have been working on fox flux a lot?  Like, _a lot_.  There's so much art and planning to do, but I'm starting to make some serious dents in both, and I'm getting pretty excited about this game.  I hope other people are too!  (And don't worry, it'll have a SFW mode.)

- **blog**: I wrote a post on [what I know about networking in games]({filename}/2017-05-22-a-few-tidbits-on-networking-in-games.markdown), which is admittedly not much.  Also I wrote half another post that I didn't publish until today so I technically can't mention it here until next week.

- **flora**: I was held at gunpoint by glip and forced to help them design my own characters, which is, extremely cool and good.  I'm starting to think they like doing creative work with me and think I have interesting ideas??

- **art**: I painted [a picture](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/867960854611763200), which is sort of fox flux concept art.

- **veekun**: Whoa hot damn I worked on veekun a bit.  I finished up item parsing, though I didn't quite get as far as loading items into the db.  So, uh, not a whole lot, but I've dipped my toes in so now it's fresh in my mind and should be easier to keep working on.

I'm feeling pretty good?  It's nice to have a couple of big projects to work on that hold my interest and offer enough variety that I can do _something_ no matter what kind of mood I'm in.
