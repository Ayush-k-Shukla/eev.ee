## My first computer

I could swear I've written about this before, but I can't find it, so it must've never escaped Twitter.

My _very very first_ computer was this bad boy, which I had when I was 9 or 10:

The VTech PreComputer 1000, from back in the days when "1000" still sounded futuristic.  It had a screen with one entire row of pixellated LCD characters, a qwerty keyboard complete with Caps Lock (?!), and a wide variety of trivia games.  Ran on _six_ C batteries.

I seem to recall that the behavior of Caps Lock was to _reverse_ the usual capitalization, by which I mean holding Shift while Caps Lock was on would produce lowercase characters.  Wild.

In a kind of precursor to DLC, there were also several extra cartridges you could buy.  They were about the size of a thick wallet and came with different sets of...  more trivia games.

Then there was the part that changed my life forever: a built-in BASIC interpreter.

It was a huge, huge pain in the ass.  I could only see or edit one line at a time, of course.  There was also no writable internal storage — this machine was released in 1988, when the idea of a video game that could save your progress was still novel! — so any program I wrote was lost as soon as I turned the thing off.

It did come with a book full of documentation and sample programs.  The documentation was helpful enough to get me to make some things, but perhaps not particularly well aimed at the target audience of 9-year-olds, as I remember there being several constructs I didn't understand in the slightest.  The sample programs weren't described particularly well, had no comments at all (did the interpreter even support comments?), and sometimes ran beyond 30 lines.  30 lines doesn't sound like a lot to me _now_, but it was much more daunting when I had to type them on a single-line display.  I'm not sure why the sample programs weren't built into the ROM, come to think of it.

I really wish I could find a copy of the book online, but it predates the web, alas!  This was all so long ago that I can't really remember any of the sample programs.  I want to say there was the usual "guess a number" game, a temperature converter, and maybe hangman?  Haven't the foggiest idea what kind of little programs I wrote from scratch, unfortunately.

I'm tempted to go find and buy one of these, partly for the nostalgia and partly to see how much I can convince a baby BASIC to do.  Mine might even still be in my parents' attic, if they haven't thrown it out by now.

While I resist the urge to scour ebay, let's move on a year or two.


## My first actual computer

We got it in the mid-90s — a 486 DX running Windows 95.  It screamed along at 25 MHz, and if that wasn't enough for you, it had a _turbo button_ that would boost it all the way to 100 MHz!  It came with a huge CRT monitor with an incredible high-def resolution of 1024×768.  (The full-size photo of the PreComputer above is 1024×801.)  It had a keyboard lock, too, which I eventually learned how to pick using a paperclip.

I distinctly remember its price tag of $1999.  I didn't know what many things cost when I was 10, nor did I have any sense of how much money people with jobs actually made, so that might as well have been "infinity dollars".  Twenty years later, you can buy a _phone_ that's orders of magnitude better than that computer for a third of the price.

I graduated naturally from toy-computer-BASIC to a _real_ programming language: QBasic.  I first encountered it on school computers, and mostly enjoyed it for the fascinating sample programs, `nibbles.bas` ([Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29)) and `gorillas.bas` (a game where two large gorillas standing on skyscrapers try to throw exploding bananas at each other).  I remember scrolling through their source code numerous times, having absolutely no idea how any of it worked.  I didn't really understand the feeling at the time, but I'm sure I was amazed and confused at how the same tools I'd used to make guess-a-number could also make these graphical, uh, masterpieces.

Lurking in there is a critical stop along the way to several flavors of enlightenment: realizing and internalizing that the amazing creative things you see and admire were just made by regular people, using regular tools.  You can do it too.

I only remember one notable thing I made in QBasic in those days.  I must've still been in middle school, which would mean I was 9 or 10?  I got regular homework that involved taking a set of vocabulary words and making "word pyramids" out of them, like this:

    c    d
    ca   do
    cat  dog

...except that the words were more like ten letters long.  I guess the point was to learn their spelling, but as someone who was just fine at spelling thank you very much, I thought this was agonizingly boring and a waste of time.  So I decided to write a program to do it.  I spent well over a week on it, but I did it, and it worked!  I managed to get pyramids (effectively squares, really) of different sizes arranged on a page automatically and to print out (directly to the _printer_) one line at a time.  I felt like a fucking wizard for what may have been the first time.

Alas, the teacher wouldn't accept a printout for some reason.

The 486 was the family computer for a while, what with its being our only one, but after a few years my parents bought a better one (a _Pentium!_) and I inherited the 486.  The glorious beast.  I must've been 11 or 12.

This was just before the turn of the millenium, right when digital music was getting popular.  By "digital music", of course, I mean "Napster", as the music industry was still a few years away from hearing that the Internet exists.  You could download a massive 4 MB MP3 of your favorite song in only ten minutes!

_You_ could, anyway.  _I_ could not.  My 486 couldn't decode MP3s in real time, even with the turbo button.  In other words, it took more than one second to understand one second of music.  I think I had a single WAV, but 40MB was a huge chunk of my 851MB hard drive (later improved to 1.2GB thanks to [DoubleSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DriveSpace)), so I mostly listened to MIDIs.

The timeline is a bit fuzzy, but at some point I graduated from QBasic to a few different things.  I think the earliest was some proprietary shareware scripting language I'd read about in PC Magazine or whatever; it was clumsy, but it could be triggered by hotkeys and manipulate existing programs, which let me do more interesting tinkering than the confines of a command prompt would allow.  I want to say it was "Wilson WindowWare" or something similarly alliterative; that finds me a extant company with a product called "[WinBatch](http://www.winbatch.com/winbatch.html)".  The name doesn't ring a bell, but it fits the description, so maybe that was it.

I ended up with a copy of Visual Basic 6 at some point (free copy on a CD with a magazine, maybe?) and built a few little toy programs with it, like a color picker and a really bad "encryption" program.  I also got into JavaScript (!) for a little while, back before anyone was even saying "DHTML", back when XSS was unheard of and I was free to embed rainbow-text JS into a forum post.  That largely fell by the wayside when I discovered server-side Perl, which was _magical_.  [veekun](http://veekun.com/) was probably the first _big_ thing I tried to build (and stuck with for more than a month or two).


## My first built computer

I was still using a 486 in 2000 or 2001, at which point it was comically obsolete.  Again, the timeline is fuzzy here, because I could swear that I got a new machine by 2001, but I distinctly remember building it in a place I thought I only lived in 2003.  I don't think I had an extra machine in the middle there, either.

I couldn't tell you much about the process of building it, but I imagine it went much the same as my experience with building computers now: get a bunch of parts, wiggle them together because everything only fits one way, spend all day trying to figure out why it doesn't boot only to find that a stick of RAM is sticking out one millimeter too far.

It was a Pentium tower, which was quite a change.  I named it `kabigon`, the Japanese name for Snorlax, beginning a theme that I've continued ever since.

I also put Gentoo on it for reasons I cannot fathom.  This was back in the day when the "real" way to install Gentoo was from stage1, which means you don't get an installer; you just get a massive, massive list of instructions on how to manually bootstrap everything from scratch.  It took _days_ to get a working system, including a day or two to compile X and KDE, but I sure did learn a lot about Linux and how a desktop environment is put together.

I'm not sure XP was actually out at this point, so consumer Windows still had no built-in way to share an Internet connection, and ISPs weren't yet giving out routers.  The very concept of a router was still pretty alien.  Up until this point, we'd been sharing the connection via some terrible shareware garbage called WinGate (which is somehow [_still around_](http://www.wingate.com/)) that mostly worked, except when it didn't.  I, despite having no clue what the hell I was doing, offered to instead have _my_ computer act as the router, because Linux is better at being a router than Windows ME.  Which is true!  The plan almost fell apart when my parents got tired of waiting for days for me to finish creating a computer, but in the end I did manage to get `kabigon` acting as the router, by blindly pasting a bunch of `iptables` rules my boyfriend gave to me.  Hm, actually, I think my interest in Linux can all be traced back to (and squarely blamed on) him.

In 2003 I was also in a high school programming class.  The class really had two classes taught at the same time: computer science 1, where the teacher taught maybe 16 or 20 kids to do simple stuff in QBasic; and computer science 2, where four of us who vaguely knew what we were doing basically had free reign.  I'd taken the AP Computer Science AB class and exam a year or two prior (and was nearly constantly mystified by why C++ was such a pain in the ass compared to everything else I knew), so by now I was finally dipping my toes into building slightly more complex stuff.

One such thing I remember well is an implementation of [Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29), the board game on a hexagonal grid where two players try to be the first to connect their two opposite sides of the board.  I remember it so well, in fact, that I have managed to exactly reproduce the source code and [placed it in this gist just for you](https://gist.github.com/eevee/aa71799e7ec0a4981ee13ea8185b854c).  Also I made this screenshot.

Or maybe I just still have most of the code I wrote in that class because I'm a packrat.  I'm glad, too, because it's the oldest window I have into what the heck I was doing thirteen years ago.  I see I was also showing off.  At one point the computer science 1 class had been told to write a change-giving program, where you enter a cost and an amount paid, and the program spits out the assortment of coins and bills you should get back.  It's not too difficult a problem; read a line of input, do a little math, print out a few numbers.  I, however, decided that not only would I also write this program, but I would be a total dick about it.

{% photo /media/2016-04-05-precomputer/change.png Giving change %}

Don't worry, I've got [the source code for that, too](https://gist.github.com/eevee/21def460854e675438a0353246385885)!  And it is unreadable slop.

I also remember an assignment about drawing a picture using QBasic's drawing primitives.  So I dug up a picture an artist friend had drawn me, reduced it to 16 colors, and wrote a Perl script to generate a QBasic program that would render it one pixel at a time.  Alas, I don't have the source code for that.

But my greatest achievement was probably writing a Chip's Challenge clone, complete with a bunch of tiles that were supposed to be in the eternally-delayed Chip's Challenge 2 (incidentally, [now released at last](http://www.chipschallenge2.com/)).  I had no understanding of a game clock or an event queue or any of that nonsense, so it's entirely turn-based; the game waits for you to move, and then the entire world updates.  I never got around to making any monsters, so it would've been purely puzzle-based, except I never got around to making any levels, either.  I don't think you could even die; the game would just not let you walk onto hazards.  Also it was just DOS characters, no graphics.  I _was_ working on a level editor, but never finished it.  Tragic.

{% photo /media/2016-04-05-precomputer/chips.png Just like Chip's Challenge, except not very good at all %}

That's all of interest I can remember.  A couple years later, I was in college, playing a lot of World of Warcraft and making bad stubs of websites that never saw the light of day.
