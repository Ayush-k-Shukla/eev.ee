home-desc: fascinating but true facts about yours truly

Hello!  I'm Eevee.  I do also have a legal name, but it doesn't see much use outside of forms and bills.  I respond to any pronoun; pick your favorite.

I like to fuss with computers until they sort of do something neat if I squint a bit, then get distracted and go try something else.  I've left a trail of [freely-available](https://github.com/eevee) [code](/projects/) in my wake.  Patches always, always welcome.

My area of "expertise" (ha!) is all over the place; I've been known to ramble about usability and interface design, Unicode, Web development and deployment, Linux, programming architecture, Python, why my database is less bad than yours, infosec, programming language design, and probably something else by this time next week.  I've also got passing interests in linguistics, various forms of puzzles, and oh yes Pok√©mon.  I can't very well draw, play the piano, take beautiful photos, write fiction, or speak Japanese, but sometimes I try.

I like to write about these things sometimes, and I'm told people like to read it sometimes.  I love thoughtful argument; finding out I'm wrong means I get to be more right in the future.  Just [don't be a dick](/blog/2014/04/05/comment-policy/).

I eject far too many thoughts in overly compact form into [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee).  I also have a [tumblr](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/), which is mostly used for personal things (read: porn), phone-camera cat photos, and arguments with teenagers.

I currently work for [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/) from the comfort of my home in Las Vegas.  I live with my [ridiculous cat](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/68035288334/anise-up-to-no-good-taken-with-nexus-5-camera-if), my [partner](http://purplekecleon.tumblr.com/), her three cats, her [husband](http://marlcabinet.tumblr.com/), his [dog](http://purplekecleon.tumblr.com/post/20032992426/twigswalk), and our boyfriend.
