home-desc: fascinating but true facts about yours truly

Hello!  I'm Eevee.  I do also have a legal name, but it doesn't see much use outside of forms and bills.  I respond to any pronoun; pick your favorite.

I like to fuss with computers until they sort of do something neat if I squint a bit, then get distracted and go try something else.  I've left a trail of [freely-available](https://github.com/eevee) [code](/projects/) in my wake.  Patches welcome!

I wear a lot of hats and have a lot of interests; I have some strong opinions on usability and interface design, Unicode, Web development and deployment, Linux, programming architecture, Python, why my database is less bad than yours, infosec, programming language design, and probably something else by this time next week.  Sometimes I draw, write fiction, or take photos.

I like to write about these things sometimes, and I'm told people like to read it sometimes.  I love thoughtful argument; finding out I'm wrong means I get to be more right in the future.  Just [don't be a dick](/blog/2014/04/05/comment-policy/).

I eject far too many thoughts in overly compact form into [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee).  I also have a [tumblr](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/), which is mostly garbage, but has a lot of old cat photos on it.

I'm currently trying to make a [living](https://www.patreon.com/eevee) on my own, working on things I enjoy.  I live in Las Vegas with my [ridiculous cat](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/68035288334/anise-up-to-no-good-taken-with-nexus-5-camera-if), my [partner](http://purplekecleon.tumblr.com/), their three cats, and their [husband](http://marlcabinet.tumblr.com/).
