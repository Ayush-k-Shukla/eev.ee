Hello!  I'm Eevee.  I dabble in miscellaneous things.

I wrote [veekun](http://veekun.com/), a Pokémon database (with [considerable help](http://veekun.com/props)).

I sort of generally do [computers](https://github.com/eevee).  I'm not great at finishing my own endeavors, but I've contributed work to a number of open source projects.

I [write about various things](/blog/) — [programming languages](/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), [usability](/blog/2016/02/10/we-have-always-been-at-war-with-ui/), [game development](/blog/2015/12/19/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-1/), [electrical engineering](/blog/2015/02/13/starbound-airlock/), [scaling social interactions up to platforms of millions](/blog/2016/02/15/everyones-offended-these-days/), and who knows what else.

I'm learning to draw.  Most of my work only ends up on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee), which is also full of bad jokes and cat photos.  Eventually I'll get around to collecting some of it into a little art gallery, but I'm not _that_ good yet.

I [dabble in making games](/everything/tags/mario-maker/).

I help my partner with the technical side of their [webcomic](http://floraverse.com/).

I'm currently supported by [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/eevee), a service that lets you give me a few bucks a month so I can keep doing what I'm doing.  There are milestones that compel me to write more things every month, if you'd like to see that happen.

I live in Las Vegas with my [ridiculous cat](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/68035288334/anise-up-to-no-good-taken-with-nexus-5-camera-if), my [partner](http://glitchedpuppet.com/), their three cats, and their [husband](http://marlcabinet.tumblr.com/).
